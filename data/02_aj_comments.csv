GL1JdIeoo4A,"Rubbish documentary. The producers have foresight of a goldfish. All you need to do is look a little further on the consequences of a drug addicted society, THAT is what everyone should fear.
The protesters put emphasis on the punishment, not a single one dare argue the crime. Everything is forgivable, until it happens to your own child. I sleep in peace knowing my kids are safe from peddlers.",2023-08-01T14:11:50Z
GL1JdIeoo4A,"Being Singaporean, i have 2 minds on this. One is that yes, it makes people think twice about trying to smuggle or bring in drugs into Singapore and for that we have a very safe country but also i feel for the people who HAVE lost someone to the hangman. I always imagine if it was someone i knew or love who could by a sick twist of fate be on the receiving end and it makes me shudder. But unless our government can find an alternative to this ( if they ever want to that is ), i guess it's something we have to live with.",2023-08-01T09:02:30Z

GL1JdIeoo4A,"Whilst I feel sorry for the family of the executed woman, I totally disagree that execution is not a deterrent to the illegal drugs problem. Let's remove emotions or sentiments and face the reality of the situation. What more could be more than a deterrent knowing that if you get caught trafficking illegal drugs in countries like Singapore, Malaysia or Thailand, you are very likely to get executed. The message is simple, DON'T GET INVOLVED IN ILLEGAL DRUGS TRAFFICKING!!!! This is the message human rights groups should be passing onto would be drug traffickers, instead of talking about human rights which frankly the Government's of such countries where executions take place, are not interested in hearing these human rights advocates.

GL1JdIeoo4A,"I feel their grief of losing a loved family member. The families called their family member a sick man, that he was addicted to drugs but where did these drugs come from?

Despite harsh laws, he became addicted, became a drug mule and harmed the lives of others. Wouldn’t they have wished that these harsh penalties were enforced further on illicit drug trade and their family member wouldn’t have been exposed to drugs and they would have spared from the grief instead of blaming the government that they were merciless?

It’s a cycle. If you want others to be spared from the same grief you feel, support stiffer penalties instead.",2023-07-24T05:11:14Z

GL1JdIeoo4A,Strongly agree with the strict law. Death penalty is the best for drugs traffickers. Its up to individual to proof his/her innocent. Drugs can kills many people if abuse. Not only that its a social problems too. Traffickers will be violent and control territories just to sustain their bussiness and operation. Dont talk about human rights. Its bullshit. Many talks about human rights like real but never take care of their families rights. U know the law in Singapore very well and u dealt with it. That it,2023-07-22T12:42:35Z

GL1JdIeoo4A,"its funny how the family are aware their relatives DO DRUGS, SELL DRUGS, etc. but they think of them as oh-so holy. How about those who use the drugs they sell? Don't they have families as well? You only think of yourselves as the VICTIMS, but don't really see the REAL VICTIMS.
You have been blessed with too much peace, I think. But being strict, following the rules and such is something a nation should have. All of them are already adults. They aren't children anymore.

Thank your SG gov, coz they know this and they want this to stop.. and I feel no sympathy over the punished people, coz they wanted this, they wanted not only to kill them self with drugs but also to kill others, but there are cases who got caught without knowing that they were used to bring drugs, for these kind of cases, the gov needs more consideration need to free them after finding the real dealers...",2023-07-15T08:41:35Z

People are warned against drugs trafficking, yet they still choose to do it. This speak volume of their self-will. So if  they chose their own fate by knowingly defying the law & so hv to face the consequences. Nobody put them there except themselves.

The documentary shows only one side of the story (the alleged traffickers perspective) but every coin has two sides. There MAYBE some cases where the death penalty is too severe but I guess Singapores Law is looking at the benefit for Singaporean society as a whole and not at individual cases.

In such circumstances, establishing a framework to legalize drugs while concurrently emphasizing rehabilitation efforts may be considered as a means of response. But research has shown that the effect of drugs on society is far more damaging. A pervasive drug culture, could have detrimental effects on the hard-earned progress achieved by Singapore's founding generations. Despite Singapore's stringent laws and severe penalties for drug offenses, individuals still attempt to bring drugs into the country.

We had discussed this before and many young people (that are in my friend group) all agree that strict rules and punishment are necessary due to the fact that if one was let go of their crimes of drug trafficking due to being ill, many others would also start to be more bolder in their actions and so forth. So I feel what the young people in this video are fighting for is kinda idiotic in the sense that if they see what drug does to their loved ones, they will definitely think better of the punishments of having drugs. And so I say that even though it is sad that he was most probably innocent and didn't know what was happening carrying those drugs, for the sake of Singapore's future, sacrifices have to be made as it is no tolerance. And to those of you who want to try to say what if its your family or closely related people, I would be very disappointed in them and although yes I will definitely be sad that they will be gone but they decided to carry illegal stuff they are to receive punishment. 

and also the comment the person made at the end made me think, how would she feel then if she were to be placed in a drug rampant area. I bet she would think very differently otherwise. Why would she not feel safe when they are protecting her from what could potentially harm her or her loved ones. Sometimes I really just don't get what some people are thinking

Now nature, if it be evil, often chooses wrong, and that is why you will find men of an evil nature committing errors. But the Laws desire what is just and honourable and salutary: They seek for it, and when they find it, they set it forth as a general commandment, equal and identical for all. The law is that which all men ought to obey for many reasons, but above all because every law is an invention and gift of the gods, a tenet of wise men, a corrective of errors, voluntary and involuntary, and a general covenant of the whole state in accordance with which all men in that state ought to regulate their lives... For there are two objects, men of Athens, for which all laws are framed-to deter any man from doing what is wrong and by punishing the transgressor to make the rest better men.

You never find anywhere in Singapore that has  known haunt for drug scene as the enforcement in controlling drugs is very high.  Many foreigners bring their family and children to come Singapore to be school here , knowing that it is safe and drug abuse is not tolerated by the Government or citizens of Singapore. 

 Imperial China in the past lose HK because of Opium. Their CCP made resolute promise to themselves that drug involvement is death sentence and till date, they did not fall back on their promise.

 Drugs kills and harm the social fabric of family and sanity of human being. When a person is hooked on drugs, he has nothing to look forward to except to get his next fix to get high.  He might cause a accident after getting high. He might violate any woman or female family member because of  drug abuse impairment. Simple act of robbing and theft is common occurrence for addicts.   Couriers and suppliers know the punishment is high and continued to get drug mules to carry out this hideous act of supplying drugs to continue to feed addiction or introduce others to drug.  There is no acceptance for a drug pusher to say, ""If i don;t sell it, others will"".  There is also no end of the road for addicts who always tell themselves, after this fix, i will check myself in to rehab and get some help. Which they never did. 

Thus , cut off the supply and dont let it come to Singapore. 

For news commentary to quote examples of other countries easing with drug laws to legalize such consumption, do proper research to understand why such acts were passed in their countries. You will see the financial gains for the lobbyist and industries ready to spring into action to service them.

For Singaporean & PRs of Singapore, you are prohibit by Misuse of Drug act  from consuming any schedule controlled substances worldwide. Feeling adventurous to try Magic Mushroom in Bali ? or nibble Khat in Africa ? Don't ! Singapore has advance medical device hardware position at all major checkpoints to test you out. Hair test can detect your last consumption up to 90 days.

Our government treats all drug abuser and offender the same. Local or Foreigner.  Even Singaporean, A famous chinese local actor known as ""ah nan"" was arrested by CNB while in the midst of performing Getai on Thursday 3 Aug 2006 in Ang Mo Kio Ave 10 Blk 536. 

The next time any persons in Singapore thinks how cruel , in flexible, draconian or old skool thoughts our Law can be, Think again why you can walk in the streets of Singapore without stepping on needles, stepping on pool of urine of feces that addict cannot control themselves & relief themselves spontaneously. Why no one hassle you and ask you try cannabis or K on the street, why you dont have to shift house because this blk has many drug pusher and addict, why you don't have avoid particular street or lane to avoid addicts.  Your kids dont have see expose genitals of addicts

I’ve seen documentaries of how drugs have destroyed the lives of people and it was absolutely devastating. But to think that drug dealers willingly sell these things to people knowing that it would most likely kill them is just horrifying! Were they sympathetic to their families? There should be consequences to every actions especially one that may cost the lives of hundreds if gone unnoticed. The law is used to deter people from committing such cruel practices but if they still decides to proceed, then they have already been warned. Coming from a younger generation point of view, I think many of us are very privileged to not have to experience these things. However, that also causes us to see things from only one perspective. America’s freedom of human rights have already started to seep into us. People advocate for freedom. However, if Singapore followed the US’s system then it will probably compromise the safety we once had.

The singapore government has consistently worked to prevent their city state from turning into a drug addicted version of EG america or western europe, and this should be applauded and learned from. I dont see the need to criticise their policy, and pander to permissive sociolgist led whining about drug addiction as mental illness. Drug lords arent averse to extreme violence and death, they thrive on it, (and reap what they sow). Its THEM that should be fearful. Sorry but no real sympathy for a ""loving family man"" who willingly imports illegal drugs that will ruin lives in someone elses families, and cause social conflicts. BTW its weird to see blue hair sjw's in Singapore (albeit ultra polite and placid, no potty mouth violence yet...)

Honestly it is sad situation but the families should be more angry at the convicted rather than the government. The law is clear and it applies to citizens and foreigners alike. It’s not to the benefit to the government to have this law. They do not profit or find pleasure in these things. The majority understands the necessary evil to keep their children safe. The government works for the people. 
I hope the young lady continues her battle but refocuses on the consequences of risking such behavior. How it affects drug users and their families. How it affect your own family to risk such things. It’s not a single life risk. I think campaign to educate this and the outcome will be hopefully what she intends which is no executions.",2023-04-26T10:34:35Z

The legal system is impotent. It is a bullying system.  It is like hanging the murderer who kills for a fee. How about the person who engaged him to kill? Will the law let him get away? Perhaps this might be true in Singapore? 
I say that until the drug supplier is brought to trial, the courier should not be hanged but kept in prison.  The justice system should have some responsibility too. They should do all they can to bring the supplier/syndicate to trial. I'm sure they would in a murder trial. Actus rea alone is not enough. Mens rea should also be required.

Unlike what the minister said, these ""traffickers"" smuggle quantities that would barely cost a few thousand $ in total. Unless you believe that a man with an IQ of 70 is somehow out there making millions on drugs .... Most are not el chapo nor do they become rich by this. Singapore can maintain strict enforcement while also treating each case on its merits. The idea that strict punishment means less crime has been debunked.

GL1JdIeoo4A,"The lawyer Ravi claimed that most of those executed were drug mules and belong to the minority races.

First, being a drug mule, these people are also aware of the penalty. Thus, they cannot claim to being ""just a drug mule"" after being caught and expect leniency.

Second, they are mostly of the minority races ie Indians and Malays. That they belong to the minority races should not be held against the Singapore authorities. The fact is these people are aware of the death penalty for the crimes they commit. They have only themselves to blame.

Frankly, if poverty is an excuse for them committing these crimes, then, should we not expect more crimes to be committed (not necessarily drug trafficking)?

These traffickers could easily get a job eg in F & B where you see restaurants constantly advertise for openings available. And they pay reasonably well.

In summary, while sad, it is a reality that these drug traffickers (or drug mules if we follow Ravi's assertion) are involved with their eyes wide open.

Why is it okay to kill people for some crimes and not others? Why would that suddenly be a bridge too far? How would keeping people who beat their spouses alive keep Singapore safe? How would keeping people who scam others of their life savings protect Singapore? Execute them all. But no, such crimes are somehow less of a risk to the safety of Singapore. It doesn't make sense. To argue that the only way to keep us safe is to kill all the drug mules is an irrational argument because what causes drug mules to keep popping up isn't people who don't care about the law, it's desperation and addiction. Saying things like if you were willing to do the crime you deserve the punishment to a person under those circumstances is like saying if you were willing to not be at least moderately successful in your life you deserve to starve to death. Sure you can always fault someone for their poor choices, but the choice to watch them die would be yours, not theirs. This is not a situation where there are only two options of either letting drugs destroy us or killing poor drug mules while letting drug lords go free.

GL1JdIeoo4A,"This is good. The death sentence is what keeps a small country/island like Singapore relatively low in drugs crime and safe. Want a good example? Just look at Hong Kong. With drugs comes more crimes, be it armed syndicates wanting to peddle drugs etc. Gang wars etc. Robberies, theft , and murder crime rates would also increase as addicts would absolutely run out of money to fuel their addictions. Many countries are not willing to go to that extra mile because the trade is also part of the country's income, and those who have similar laws tend to not fully enforce them also because of similar reasons (and of course corrupted government officials).

This documentary only highlights the sentence of which that comes about from committing the law, but not the consequences and seriousness of drug use (and hence trafficking).  Extremely bias. Almost as though saying that the drug traffickers who would ruin lives and countless families do not deserve such huge sentences. Furthermore, most of these protests the video mentioned comes from those whom aren't usually local, or some fools with a false sense of self-righteousness. Most Singaporean locals would usually support the severity of the law for such crimes (drug trafficking and kidnappings).

The other reason why many foreign countries are opposing such measures is because they just see Singapore as a great opportunity to earn big bucks from as Singapore is relatively wealthy. Also they do not like that some other country looks 'cleaner' than theirs as it is a slap on their faces. In other words, just plain disgusting jealousy.",2023-04-23T07:28:52Z

Everytime you touch down on Singapore's Airport, you are warned about the mandatory death penalty for a stated amount of grams per drug and that you should surrender any before entering the country. If you still choose to take on the risk and try your luck, you only have yourself to blame. So people who say they may not have knowledge of the law or don't have access to such information is spouting rubbish.

GL1JdIeoo4A,"I am a Singapore citizen. I believe many people (especially foreigners who do not live in Singapore) do not know the facts, or at least a newspaper report of the facts of the late Mr Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam’s case as I believe the facts of this drug trafficking case is not reported by any newspaper in your own country.

(Of course, I must admit that I also get to learn about the case from the report made by our national newspaper, The Straits Times, of which I have quoted the following from.)

This drug trafficker Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam was arrested in 2009 (I stress: not 2019) at the age of 21 (I stress: not below 18 whom we regard as minor) with a bundle of heroin strapped to his thigh (I stress: the drug was NOT found in his luggage or vehicle or other belongings away from his body).

He was sentenced to death by our High Court in 2010 after being convicted of trafficking 42.72g of heroin.

Our relevant law, the Misuse of Drugs Act, provides for the death penalty if the amount of heroin imported is more than 15g.

Our Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal against his conviction and sentence in July 2011. His execution was put on hold as our Government was then carrying out a review of the mandatory death penalty.

In 2013, the law was changed to give judges the discretion to impose life terms and caning for drug couriers, instead of death, if specific conditions are met.

Nagaenthran applied on 24 February 2015, to be re-sentenced under the new regime.

One of the issues considered was whether his mental responsibility was substantially impaired at the time of his offence.

After considering the facts and expert evidence from FOUR psychiatry and psychology experts, our High Court held that Nagaenthran knew what he was doing, and upheld the death sentence in 2017.

The court noted that he was continuously altering his account of his education qualifications, ostensibly to reflect lower educational qualifications each time he was interviewed.

In 2019, the Court of Appeal said it was satisfied that Nagaenthran clearly understood the nature of his acts.

It noted that he knew it was unlawful for him to be transporting drugs and he tried to conceal the bundle by strapping it to his left thigh and wearing a large pair of trousers over it.

This was the working of a criminal mind, weighing the risks and countervailing benefits associated with the criminal conduct in question, the court added.

Nagaenthran was granted the stay of his execution, on last week Tuesday, by a three-judge Court of Appeal that was urgently convened to hear his challenge against his death sentence.

The execution of this Malaysian drug trafficker, Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam, was subsequently stayed after he tested positive for Covid-19.

Again, this Nagaenthran is a Malaysian and he was aged 21 when he was caught for drug trafficking.

Therefore, if anyone still insists that he is a intellectually disabled person, we must take note that, among many other material particulars, the following non crime related points:

1. He was 21 - an adult and NOT a minor who is below 18; AND
2. He has applied for and possessed and used an international passport to travel from his country to go to a cross border destination on his own; AND
3. He knows how to clear the immigration checkpoint at his country on his own; AND
4. He knows how to attempt to clear the Singapore immigration checkpoint on his own; AND
5. He was fully aware that a bundle of something was strapped to his thigh at the material time, AND
6. He did not carry any intention at all to declare the item that was oddly strapped to his thigh when he was clearing the immigration checkpoint in Singapore.

In this respect, to argue that he is incapable to understand his acts at all is too far stretching.

Finally, the intention of my writing here is to just share the facts, I do not intend to debate with anyone as to whether should the death penalty be abolished in my country or globally.",2023-04-16T05:44:45Z

Those who speak about abolishing these strict rules have not seen the true effects of what drugs can do to a society, so they are speaking from a place of privilege (only some), the privilege of not knowing, thus underestimating drug-related issues, which is a privilege they get to have, thanks to these strict rules. The westerners that speak about how bad these rules are, will not be there once Singapore starts going easy on drug trafficking and drug use, going to your local 7/11 will feel like an extreme sport, not purely because something will actually happen to you, but because of the anxiety that something might happen, all because someone wants money for a quick fix. Also, Singapore is a very small country, so any minor epidemic will have larger effects, as opposed to much larger countries. Sure, others might say life in prison is better, but that would mean a large sum of taxpayers' money will go into keeping drug mules in prison, and you will be shocked at how some people commit crimes just to go to prison because being in prison is better than the outside world, ""there are no bills in prison, you get a bed, food to eat and the occasional exercise"".

GL1JdIeoo4A,"7:28 I heard that during her final appeal against her son's hanging, Nagendron's mother argued that the capital punishment was being used only on the drug mules instead of the kingpins (she also almost was denied entry into Singapore for the hanging due to the pandemic). & our law minister's response was to claim that the kingpins were already deterred from Singapore by the capital punishment. Well I guess the next thing we should look at is why the mules were not deterred. Some local lawyers have observed that many traffickers were foreigners & thus less aware of Singapore's drug laws, so they might've been less deterred by it, or might've been poorer & thus the attractiveness of the revenue they stood to earn from trafficking would more likely outweigh the chances of being hanged. So we should renew calls that fighting drug trafficking needs international co-operation & can't be done by 1 country alone (though flight attendants on Singapore-registered aircraft do already warn about capital punishment via on-board annoucements just before they land in Singapore). I also remember when online comments got a bit uglier when netizens blamed Nagendron's mother for not stopping him from drug trafficking, supposedly because his family was poorer & thus the revenue from drug trafficking might have appeared more attractive",2023-03-08T06:04:40Z

GL1JdIeoo4A,"Singapore is one of the safest countries in the world for a reason. For a low crime rate and safety of the population, stringent laws should be in place to deter any form of crimes and criminals. 
If I am not wrong, did they say people who use drugs are not handed in the capital punishment but helped to rehabilitate their drug usage problems. It is the drug trafficker who get handed these punishments, which I think is the right move. 
The girl at the end has absolute no idea how debilitating and dangerous the society will become if the punishments related to drug trafficking is relaxed. These traffickers knew what they are doing and they knew what trouble they could get into if caught and yet they chose to do it for some quick money making. I know it sounds harsh but these drug traffickers do not care for the people they sell the drugs to and how adversely it impacts the lives of the drug users and their loved ones. So if they showed no empathy when selling drugs then why should the government and law should show empathy to them.
Do these people who are protesting capital punishment want Singapore to turn into dangerous place like many of the South American countries where the whole nation has come to debilitating state due to drug trafficking. What these protesters do not understand is anything related to illegal drugs, when there are no strict laws instated, there will be many more crimes that will grow within the society like gangs formation, rampant drug trafficking, crimes associated with drugs will start to spurt.

He went through the legal process in Singapore with numerous appeals to his death sentence and when they all failed he was killed. The Australian media at the time asked Singaporean people didn't they think it was wrong to take the life of a foreign national?. Their answer was ""well he have to obey the same laws or else we get the death sentence too. So what makes your citizen exempt from obeying our laws?"".

Criminalisation of drugs does not disincentivise drug use or trafficking of said drugs. People who want drugs will get them by any means necessary. So, criminalisation is not an incentive against drugs, but an incentive to merely innovate on use and transportation. 

Second, the execution of non-violent drug offenders is a horrific human rights abuse. The execution of drug offenders has lead to the erosion of civil liberties, unfair punishments of people based on their backgrounds, all while costing billions of public dollars to no benefit. 

I am from the Philippines, a country where the previous president has endorsed the War on Drugs and it is dangerous. From an average citizen's perspective, all looks peaceful, but it has lead to 27 000 killings in 6 years. I watched that happen and see that so many are in favour of it. 

Harsh punishments for drug-related offenses hurt vulnerable people like the disabled and mentally-ill the hardest, while leaving the kingpins at large. The people who get arrested aren't violent, they're just the ones who are visible.

Rehabilitation, harm reduction, and social services are the only solution, and Singapore is more than capable of it. Singapore is excels at providing high quality healthcare and housing. So, why not just continue what has already been done?",2023-02-18T01:20:34Z

It is as clear as day - that if you bring in beyond a prescribed mass of scheduled drugs, then the death penalty awaits.

If one ignores the risk to enrich themselves, they cannot then turn to seek for forgiveness and mercy.
As countries around the South East Asian region relax their rules around drug consumption and trafficking, it is more important that Singapore's stance on drugs and the death penalty cannot waver. Foreigners who enter the country should respect the laws of the land.",2023-01-29T09:16:34Z

wow impressive! 
Recently I saw on YouTube  that some Singaporeans are protesting against death sentence in Singapore and also Questioning on death sentence of Malaysians and some Singaporean  involved in drug trafficking. First of all , why you and your followers need to involve in our countries's law and order who gave you all the rights? You think  Singapore only revolve around  you people  ? You, Kokila Anamalai and those with you  going to step in each and every time to control drug trafficking or other serious offence when it's happening or before it happens in our country?  YOU, AND YOUR FOLLOWERS , OR THOSE LAWYERS WHO IS FIGHTING FOR THIS KINDA OF. PEOPLE going to protect us ?  CAN YOU ALL GIVE ASSURANCE  I have a question for  Kokila Anamalai  first question , intellectually disable IQ level 68 that person should be pardon , I am abit confused , was he mentally unstable that he was totally insane totally  mad that he was not aware or realized what is happening or what is.he  getting himself into? Well I totally don't think so cause I have heard and saw in lots of movies to escape from gallows plead as insanity and I am pretty sure that this will be the famous advice given by most of the lawyers. If such a intellectual disabled LOW IQ  person is so capable of involving in drug trafficking and executing it nearly perfect then what about the normal IQ level people and their capabilities wow I am really impressed. Second question Kokila Anamalai  I really appreciate on your concern about human's life then what about those people as specially youngsters and family men who lost their lives either by consuming or  by possession and was sentenced to death or becomlng  drug addict and abandon their family or abuse them physically and what about their family, children and parents who has to live with shame and go through  sufferance and live with grieved and pain because of losing their love ones or seeing their love ones destroying their own lives . Those people who lost their lives because of drugs  their lives is not important? Aren't they suppose to be alive ? How they become a prey? How they got the drugs? From where they got the drugs?  From who they got the drugs? From a selfish money minded ruthless drug traffickers or shall I say also from  intellectual disabled IQ 68 selfish money minded ruthless drug traffickers, Not only them for rapist who rape and destroy children and ladies for their few minutes pleasure  also should be hanged   Certain Laws are definitely needed to uphold justice, for safety of their country people and to have a peaceful country. Definitely it's very important to instinct a fear when whoever thinks that they can do whatever they want in order to destroy the peace of a country in any form for their selfish reasons then death sentence  is A MUST AND MOST APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT to remind those people that don't  take our Singapore's Law for granted. And out of all the people , You Kokila Anamalai should know better being a Indian what's happening in India how many of them running to our country for safety reasons and ofcourse to  make money too and what will be the consequences when a country has NO PROPER LAW AND ORDER riots, chaos and finally the government has no control over the situations. I salute,  respect and thankful to our Singapore Government PAP for upholding the Law and Justice regardless of whoever it is or where ever they are from. Singapore Law is neutral to everyone whether you are a foreigner or local. In order to stop some continuation of serious crime Death Penalty is the best solution. We DON'T  require any changes nor intervene from anyone nor any organization . As being a born  Singaporean I am proud to be in such a safest country rest assured our government has the best Law and Order, they know very well what are the laws to implement and why it's necessary and what are the measure they need to take for their fellow Singaporean's safety and well-being cause our PAP government is here for us for decades and ruling Singapore with pride and respect they know what is best for Singaporeans and don't forget the law is definitely protecting you, your family and as well as your followers and  also those lawyers who are taking up such a case and defending such a ruthless people too . I strongly think that, you and those who are protesting against death penalty didn't lost their love ones due to drug consumption and your family member's wife, children and parents  are NOT suffering because of drug addict's abuse nor can't face the societies criticism for no reason what about their sufferance, their pain,  their lost who is going to fight for them  those who were hanged or waiting to be hanged (drug traffickers) are the people who brought the drugs to their life just for their greed.  As A Singaporean just because Singapore gives you the rights to share your thoughts don't  misused it  DON'T MISGUIDE PEOPLE DON'T INSTIGATE PEOPLE  FOR YOUR POPULARITY  FOR ONCE Mr.  Anamalai ask your daughte ,Kokila  TO GROW UP AND THINK MATURELY  ,there are so many people genuinely  need help and care on other necessary issues use your time wisely AND FOR GOOD DEEDS tell those who are also wasting their time with you guide them to do good deeds too!  
P. S. IF ANY OF MY CHILDREN BREAK SUCH A LAW AND NEED TO BE HANGED I WILL NEVER EVER FEEL SORRY  NOR WASTE MY TEARS FOR THEM NOR WRITE A PARDON LETTER EVEN THEY ARE INTELLECTUALLY DISABLE WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO DO  MISTAKE YOU FACE THE CONSEQUENCES as a mum this is what I told my children and brought them up

As a US trained psych, ID is given as a diagnosis when the FSIQ is less than 70 AND deficits in the social functioning. And there are psychological measures to measure feigning and malingering in psych to aid with the Court decision. This is how the US legal system engaged and used the psychologists, however, in Singapore who still relies solely on psychiatrist as expert witness... I question that.

We have to be accountable for our own actions. I do not and will never understand why people touch drugs in the first place knowing full well that it is illegal and will put you on death row.

The problem with today's society is that governments expect society and the people to do the right thing even when no one is looking. However, it is evident that without laws, people will always take the easy way out even if it means breaking the law which is the reason why governments exist in the first place.

However, when the death penalty is extended to crimes other than murder, such as blasphemy and adultery in backwards islamic nations, or drug offenders in the case of Singapore, all justice officials involved should be declared ""judicial terrorists"" and subject to sanctions similar to the Magnitsky act. I would go further and say the judges should get the same treatment as Osama Bin Laden. Whilst not a drug taker myself, I do know some drug casualties and it is not pretty. However it was their decision to try drugs, and eventually they got clean. I see drugs as a public health issue. As for the argument that they are tough only on dealers and smugglers rather than users,many of these people are also users (user dealers) and will take any risk to supply their habit. Finally, the ""War on Drugs"" in the USA did not achieve its objective and massively increased the prison population. So this evil policy in Singapore is a primitive form of human sacrifice in the name of a superstition. Personally it has caused me to hate this nation and its people. Of course, my nation has its own shame regarding the (long abolished) death penalty and as for the people on the streets, this is due to the introduction of neoliberal economics and the homeless are not all addicts.",2023-01-26T00:01:49Z

There were 84 homicides in New Zealand in 2022 and drive-by shootings perpetrated by gangs on a weekly basis, including ones where the wrong addresses and innocent people were hit (research and read up about the 14-years-old girl who is still recovering from a drive-by gun shot wound, amongst other examples). In Singapore, there were 7 homicides, no drive-by shootings, no gang problems. Streets are much safer.

NZ police shoot way more people than Singapore police does; NZ police arrest way more people in general - NZ has over 36,000 people serving a sentence or on a bail order, that number in Singapore is only 11,000, less than one-third as much. With that many more people being charged it's a statistical certainty that NZ has far more wrongly convictions - at least over 1,000 in the past decade!

Singapore's 'war' on drugs is not deadly.

And all this is made even more impressive when you consider that Singapore has a larger population than NZ! And it's completely urbanized (most crime issues in NZ occur in urban centres).

Don't believe the stats? Let me bring you on a tour around sketchy South Auckland etc. No area in Singapore comes close.

I'm not even finished. Singapore's recidivism and reoffending rate (20%) are one of the lowest, if not the lowest in the world; NZ's recidivism and reoffending rate is much higher at 65%+. This shows they have a more successful counseling program in SG.

And here's the interesting info that many are unaware of: SG is stringent on drug TRAFFICKING, not drug abuse. Drug abuse actually lands people in rehab (DRC) and by default is not even a criminal record. There are actually more people in NZ being  charged and ultimately holding a criminal record for petty drug crimes. Meanwhile SG executes on average about four people per year.

1. Size, other bigger countries with multiple cities can afford one or two to become drug ghettos and it won't affect the country as much as a whole. Singapore has ONE city, lose that and its game over.
2. Aging population. This is already a nightmare of a problem to solve and you want to add drug related problems? We're talking about a good chunk of able bodied youth that will be lost to drugs to Sg's already dwindling youth population. Not only they will not contribute back to society, but will drain resources rehabiliting them.
3. Resources/economy. It's no secret that the only natural resource Sg has is manpower. If already lose a percentage of the manpower population to drugs, then add the drug related crimes that comes with it. Then the country will be less safe, in turn scare away businesses, trades, industries, talents, etc. Who's gonna put bread on the table then? How is the country gonna sustain itself?

So you'd rather the country collapse to spare a few who are too foolish or desperate to ignore the ""DEATH TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS"" printed in bold and clear on every Sg entry card?

If the authorities and government claim is it is necessary, then at the very least, the legal system needs to be completely above board and transparent in the processing and sentencing in these cases. Right now there is lack of clarity on how and why the police and the courts can intersect, the lack of privacy of legal communications between prisoners and lawyers or families, and even the permitted use of testimony from police instead of a requirement for hard evidence only. There is a truly bizarre and robotic pursuit of expedience in these cases with prosecutors going out of their way to prevent any legal challenges from getting to court, and financial penalties and what can even be seen as harassment against the death rights lawyer M. Ravi for trying any legal means of getting his clients off the hook. Why rush to the kill? If there is a shred of doubt should it not be examined? What I want to see is 1. an option to commute to a life sentence for those who are intellectually or mentally disabled not to just those who were underage when apprehended, 2. the improvement of the legal process and a better tolerance for the legal representatives of the death row prisoners instead of slapping abuse of process fines on them 3. the removal of such penalties for cannabis which is now recognised as having genuine palliative benefits and also is far less health damaging than alcohol, 4. allow legal counsel during an investigation,5. improved mental health care, which even for non drug addicts is not great, and access to free legal alternatives for these illegal addictive substances. 6. Finally, a more humane approach for families of the condemned, such as payment of travel costs and housing for them in the period leading to their execution for overseas family members, and not executing the prisoners before a reasonable period is allowed after the final appeals have been made, for family to come and say goodbyes..

It’s not good to take someone’s life. But the thing is actvists should point there frustrations to the people responsible selling, distributing and protecting drugs not against a government that is helping to prevent drugs spread. Drugs is the most difficult and most corrupt enemy of all. It will not stop. If we just leave drugs alone it will turn to more violence. There are more deaths and sufferings in the proliferation of drugs than killing a dealer or a drug lord. Yes! Everybody deserves a chance. But a dealer deals with drugs in a daily basis. They victimize a lot of innocent people, specially the young, everyday. They only say they regret it if they got caught. If not then there is no regret. And I get it, mostly the reason is poverty but it’s not an excuse. You think destroying or killing someone’s life will get you out of poverty? Remember everybody has a choice. Wether we like it or not it’s our responsibility. And there is no gray area in crimes. It’s only good and bad. And what’s the point of having laws if we don’t follow it? Then, what’s the point of democracy? These activists should think as a whole.

It seems to me that most of the cases in this documentary are drug abusers who are intending on using the drugs for themselves. If my assessment has merit, the death penalty seems quite a harsh punishment. Since the outcome is the death penalty, wouldn’t a person with trafficking intent attempt to enter with a lot more to make the risk financially worth it?  It’s easy for a tiny island country to think it’s controlling the problem this way … but it would be more effective to focus enforcement resources on the big guys who as far as I can tell, rarely seem to get caught.

GL1JdIeoo4A,"Singapore policies saw drugs as the opportunity to get rid a targeted group off the social outcast , 2nd class citizens , the lower tier of socio economic. 
     Is it just coincidence  that those groups are made out of Malay and Indians? We almost never hear of drug addiction  in the higher economic groups. It is naive if really think there are no junkies in the rich communities. Why we haven't hear of them is bcoz they would never get charge for trafficking. They are the functioning junkies, from pilots , lawyers , accountants , engineers.  They don't sell them , they got the extra money to feed their addiction. These groups don't mingle in the lower tier of junkie society. They even got the money to go to a private rehab if and when needed.
    Majority that needs to traffic drugs are junkies themselves. How many drug traffickers in Singapore really make serious money? If they did , they would leave Singapore ASAP..
     It's very arrogant and condescending to say that 'bcoz u are poor , no death penalty' ..... Dey tambi! it will never be from the higher socio economic group bcoz they don't need to sell drug to feed their habit. It the lower income group of street peddlers that got label drug trafficking. 
    Singapore legalize sports betting and casinos which also have high number of gambling and alcohol addiction. 
I wonder why they hang drug addict bit not gambling addict and alcohol addicts a.k.a  alcoholic? It is very prejudice and was set in motion at the beginning of 1980.

GL1JdIeoo4A,"Kudos to the law in spore on drug trafficking. As what Bruce an ex-inmate shared in the video, 1 of his reasons to quit is the death penalty. The law should be firm on drug trafficker. Addiction to drugs have seen loved ones being victim of violence or even fall to threats by the abuser. In the past 70s or 80s because of family situation, surrounding etc etc drug starts at a very age. In today's generation it is still the same with drug being easily accessible & in different forms (social media, Internet) it still starts at a young age. Can we say, the family had drug abuser, so the future generation from the family may also fall into that category? Its not as if a thief gets his punishment by his hand being chopped off. Not all crime leads to death penalty it all depends on the nature of the crime and how it destroy a family, a loved one or even a society. Drug abuser are sent to rehab, they aren't hanged. They are even out on programmes, going to work while serving sentence etc. I feel Singapore government is doing a fabulous justice in handling the topic DRUGS!! It is indeed sad to see the loved ones to die in this manner. Families play a crucial role in their loved ones life hence it is the families responsibility to care, educate, create awareness and stand by the abuser even before it's too late. I have spoken to  addicts who share their families aren't there when they 'need them' and sometimes their families 'don't understand' what they are going through (these are the words from them) so if families were there from the start maybe some couldn't have even commit the crimes.",2023-01-23T17:50:24Z

GL1JdIeoo4A,"We should show empathy for those on death row,  but we should also show appreciation for the strict laws that have given us a safe society. To those activist protesting the death penalty, maybe, just maybe you should try living in the United States where shooting is happening at an alarming rate or in the South Americas where drug cartels run the society.
To argue that most of the traffickers are categorized as the less ""privileged"" or poor of the society, is just utter disrespect to those that belong in the same group. They are the minorities of the entire less ""privileged"" or poor. There are also the less privileged or poor of the society that didn't choose to become a trafficker, so please stop that bullshit. If the law doesn't execute these people as a show of deterrence, are we going to send them all to your house so you experience life with them? Perhaps these idiotic activists should start and fund a centre to keep and feed all these traffickers. Back up your voices with some tangibles, for abolishing the death penalty.
The law has stated very clearly the consequences of drug trafficking.

in the other side, there's also the long term impact to not execute the drug traffickers. i mean take a look at the infamous Mexico drug cartels where they can do almost anything. shooting people on the street, shootout with rival gang, bribing (some even said bought) local authorities. that causing even more death to innocent people and that not including the actual abuse of the drugs. life imprisonment sometimes doesn't work at all. especially when catching a drug lord or a big shot in the catrtel.

I actually felt enormous sympathy for her plight. And in my culture, it is quite difficult to say no to older people. Luckily for me I was spotted by a female staff of the airport and she showed up right in front of my face with a microphone and blurted out, ""Please do not accept any items from strangers"" over and over again. And at that point I entirely refused to listen to anything the old woman had to say even though she tried to make me feel guilty and called me rude and disrespectful for suggesting she might be a drug trafficker. 
To think that a woman in her 60's would think nothing about ruining a teenagers life still baffles me to this day and I have not trusted older people since that day.
I still remain grateful for the Heathrow staff's intervention to this day.",2023-01-22T20:35:37Z

As I recall, not a single such case has ever occurred.  The law courts are simply taking the easy way out to contain the drug problem which has obviously not been eradicated. The country most certainly has blood on its hands by killing these poor desperate 'salespersons' and personal abusers trying to make little cash on the side.  I am not saying that these pushers are let off. Instead they should do time and go for rehabilitation. The cases however, should not and must not be closed until the actual perpetrators of the crime are brought to task! The person charged should be kept in remand or let out on bail until the actual perpetrators are brought in. It's like finding the murder weapon or the dead body and the person committing the action ( actes rea) and person who wanted or planned  the murder to be committed  (mens rea).

GL1JdIeoo4A,"I am a retiree and I support such capital punishment for drug traffickers. Most youngsters in Singapore today may not actually appreciate the magnitude of the problems drug abuses created in the past and the horrors they to the society. It is bad enough that when a person abuses illegal drugs, they often not only destroy themselves, but often, also hurt others around them. Drug trafficking is even worst. These people are one of the worst predators of society. Laws must be just and beneficial to the society, even if they can be harsh. It is wrong to misplace sympathy and support the perpetuators of such crimes rather than their victims. For those who do, they should be made to face all the past victims, their loved ones and their dependents, and see if they can convince these innocent victims why the perpetuators of such crimes should be let off. For those who argued that some of these mules are innocents, they may be right. However, they often generalized where the justice processes can go awry and 'innocent' mules are wrongly punished. To these people, I would say that they should leave it to the court to decide. Singapore court is generally fair, robust and just. For if such arguments be allowed to prevail, no country should then have any criminal laws at all, for the possibility of wrongful judgement and abuses can theoretically occur no matter how unlikely.  However, if drug traffickers are allowed to bring illegal drugs freely into Singapore, these unwitting protestors better hope that they don't become victims themselves. Finally, they should also visit some of the cities in the world where drug abuses are rampant, and see for themselves what these illegal drugs can do to a society; the homeless drug zombies living on the sidewalks, the heart-breaking sufferings the victims and their loved ones have to go through, the drug addicts grazed and incoherent demeanors, the brutal crimes perpetuated by drug lords, and the sad state of affairs where so many resources were put to fight a losing battle against such criminal gangs because such crimes are so profitable.

GL1JdIeoo4A,"- UPDATE - ( I was actually part of the local anti death penalty and human rights activists group in Singapore advocating and lobbying, generating awareness on the harms of the death penalty. We protested and performed songs in Hong Lim park against  Nagaenthran execution. His death hits differently as he was indeed mentally intellectual. On Friday (20 January 2023), the Court of Appeal will hear the appeal involving 13 prisoners — 12 of whom are on death row — whose private correspondence had, on multiple occasions, been copied and forwarded to the Attorney-General’s Chambers without their knowledge or consent. Some of this correspondence included privileged communications with lawyers. The AGC is also the state organ that had prosecuted these prisoners.

The prisoners had filed a civil suit against the AGC. It was dismissed by the High Court last year. Their appeal will be heard this Friday at 10am at the Court of Appeal in the Supreme Court building. The hearing will be in open court, so members of the public are welcome to attend. 

Among the 13 prisoners are Datchinamurthy Kataiah, who had to argue for his own stay of execution last April when the state sought to hang him even before this civil case had run its course, and Pannir Selvam Pranthaman, whose poetry has been turned into moving songs produced by Malaysian musicians and artists. Roslan bin Bakar, Rosman bin Abdullah and Syed Suhail bin Syed Zin are also part of this suit — all had received execution notices in recent years. For them, and many of the others involved in this case, this appeal is the main (if not only) thing standing between them and imminent risk of execution. 

Please attend the hearing to demonstrate support and solidarity if you can!

Time: 20 January 2023, 10am

GL1JdIeoo4A,Those who want to have drug can always leave I guess.,2023-01-19T16:40:00Z
GL1JdIeoo4A,"@24:36 The lady obviously is confused between stealing and drug pushers. We don't chop off hands for stealing in Singapore. We hang people bringing drugs (that exceeded the allowed) into Singapore to ruin the lives of residents in Singapore. The documentary only focus on the family's side and lawyer of the hanged. Why didn't it interview the families that are ruined by drugs ? Why doesn't it show the statistics for countries with death penalty for drug trafficking ? UN report for cocaine seizures in Asia for years 2014, 2015, and 2016 (latest), Indonesia and Singapore both have zero seizures. Both countries have death penalties for drug traffickers. You can see the number of drug seizures for other countries and how many people are always trying to bring drugs into those countires. The statistics show that deterrent works. If she is ""scared of death penalty"", then don't bring drugs into the country.",2023-01-19T16:37:52Z
GL1JdIeoo4A,"It is so simple! People either live by the law or go back to heaven. We can't continue to undermine our existence in the name of democracy. 
This is my dream country! Crime is an indicator of incapacity to coexist with humans. 
Corruption, rape, human trafficking, drug trafficking, terrorism and related crimes are all treasonable and shouldn't be forgiven or attract light penalty. Death penalty should be embraced back.

GL1JdIeoo4A,The true negative impact of drugs is even higher than we think. Death is also a harsh penalty. There’s no winning anywhere. It’s tough.,2023-01-19T13:34:37Z
GL1JdIeoo4A,Why not put them away for life instead ?,2023-01-19T13:24:42Z
GL1JdIeoo4A,"Singapore's stance on the mandatory death penalty is what kept the rest of their society safe and evil-doers punished. For the families who were trying to play victim in the video because their loved ones committed the crime is understandable. They only think in their own position and not for the rest of society whom may be harmed down the road should those trafficked drugs be allowed to be distributed. 

If they do not like the strict laws in Singapore, they can simply move to another country that has relaxed laws which allow them to do as they please without any consideration for the rest of society such as the western countries. People in Singapore are able to enjoy a piece of mind because of harsh punishments like that which act as a very strong deterrence as what Bruce Matthews, a former drug abuser brilliantly expressed in the video.

After looking at most of the comments it seems that an overwhelming majority of people wished that their countries had the death penalty like Singapore as well. These are the people who actually get first-hand experiences of what drug traffickers and drug lords does to the fabric of their society with families destroyed and crimes running rampant. Then there is also a small minority of people who argue against it, but their arguments mostly lack common sense and steer towards a huge sense of ""what-about-ism."" I believe that these group of people are what we term as ""woke"" these days; people who usually come from a privileged background and like to view their world through their rose-tinted glasses and speak from a high moral standpoint. Similar to the protesters in the video, lol.",2023-01-19T13:24:34Z

Look at the Philippines, is that what you want for Singapore? I would not have the slightest difficulty in avoiding being hanged, I detest drugs and wouldn't take them even if they were free. You Singaporeans have a rose tinted picture of Britain, but the Britain you remember is the Britain of long ago, but the Britain of today is on a downward slide, decadent, degenerate and almost disarmed, and drugs are one of the influences which have brought this about. Many years ago I served 15 years in the British Army, and it saddens me to see the country going downhill. Dont let Singapore go the same way.",2023-01-19T12:59:38Z

GL1JdIeoo4A,"Unless and until there is a solution to deter trafficking from across the border, Singapore will continue to rely on the death penalty to deter drug trafficking.
