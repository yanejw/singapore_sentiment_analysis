XSOgcpRbrCo,"The City of Rome with 2-Party Democratic Republic outdid and outdone Singapore any day. So we have a Rich Friendly Tyrant of Singapore/Syracus in an Asian Sicily.  Singapore painted a story of ""Trading Freedom for Money"", yet Republican Rome ""Trade Money for Freedom"" and grow to greatness. What if the real narrative was ""What if Singapore failed to become the Asian Rome?"". What if Singapore still does have the chance to become an Asian Rome if it embraces Freedom and The Polybus The Greek observations of the Massive Republic in the City of Rome?  Not sure.  Any City or Civilization that trade Money for Freedoms tends to fail, since ""Money"" and ""Riches"" is subjective, while Freedom is based in Principles and Higher Goals.  I mean, the value of Gold changes if these is an oversupply of gold. What is the value of ""Freedom of Speech""? What is the value of a successful 2-Party Democratic Republic Global Superpower?

XSOgcpRbrCo,"Many people are very moved when the Imperial leader cries, because the ALIEN MACHINE is active wherever you go.  It's like different experiments for different people, and we can't combine?  A grassroots analysis would help.  A woman asked, and so I sent cannister of saltines to Vietnam, and I'm hearing that they are looking at the different spreads and dips.  It's one of my strategies, this time I bought a wedge of cheese in five parts for rice or millet.  Without my glasses, I thought my ham was $14.50  but it was $26.00.  They say food used to be more per capita in this Country, and so you might have an animal in the neighborhood.  Hummus is my #1 spread.  I also buy expensive white dressing and mix it with olive juice.

They are talking about exports, which I don't know if the Americans have the wherewithal to make certain technical things.  The MACHINISTS want euthanasia.  They have two nice factories on Whalley Avenue.  My eugenic daughter Lilybeth can take the medication, but she knows it harmed her, because she is fragile.  That's biological against chemical, and it says in the medical library that it can't be done.  Chemicals should be recognized as having caused the worst damage.  But they are starting to say you will need to take it during EMR, and that's to cover up the EMR they want.  Of course, I guessed the most comment word clinicians use to describe themselves is 'effective.'  Are you saying I was effective with you?  Today on the way to the store, Doug noticed I was tired, and twice I said on the way back, ""I love this.""  I felt like i was at his Plantation cutting down a tree, and dragging the wood.  I always cherished I have enough muscle but not anymore.  My family members said O-oh, because they are taught to act it out but do something, and it will go away.  Then to try to come back with something, and now you are dangerous.  Pori immediately went into a trance when on BBC a woman sang, ""I lost everything.""  He is treated as if he is better but their rapist said to me, ""You needed to be brought down.""  At first herpes only hurts on the surface of the skin; now I started having herpes dementia and THEY immediately acted on the herpes dementia, and everyone knows it went wild so I couldn't even write.  

The same in the United States, they started taking an interest in young men by putting them in jail for minor violations.  The people who wanted me in jail are connected to the people who work in conjunction with the MACHINE, so the Judge sometimes suspects the actual proof.  I only put two and two together yesterday about multiple sclerosis, but the MACHINE returned my friend who was assigned to run some information past, could have gotten it from exposure to me; and evidently, they made an agreement with the MACHINISTS in Canada, where she turned out to be the star witness (so Canada won?)  The family who bought my parents house redid it completely, and Mickey was getting eczema so I introduced her to someone else.  Even though they redid the house, and Michelle's parents got a new rug that she didn't let me step on, L.P. also got M.S.  I really can't imagine why my family wouldn't tell me.  My mother did tell me about L.P., and she would say, ""Go to Michelle's,"" and Michelle would say, ""Is your father home?""  When there is a breach, often one party is disempowered in the implied contract.  I don't know what she thinks, because she has many friends and colleagues, but she found out yesterday that her exhusband had additional information.  I think any and all of the clinicians, of which there could be someone in charge of everyone if they have their way, have an obligation to assist with euthanasia and eugenics.  I feel the court should order consent of the parties to the following:  Any person at or below the bar will be up for euthanasia.  I heard someone say L.P. had a bitter attitude, but now I understand.  She needs assistance.  

Douglas Clayton III was one of the representatives in Malaysia, and he didn't do too good with the EMR.  Most Countries have their own EMR rules, but Doug owns ""the Plantation"" in New York, and also has brought the parties into order.  He is at risk for bodily harm, which the last Man in the High Castle is blind.  Besides Pori, I'm the only other case of that from neuroleptic medication, which I know of.  He was very excited because they gave the okay for intracranial narcotics, which is how my father cured my blindness.  But as an adult, they had to write CURARE in my records, meaning I can't have neuroleptics for another reason.  The police said they could tell. They know I'm a very difficult case, but it's as if they told Doug he would be released if he could break me in order.  At my first adult dosage, Margaret Trinity (""Bonnie"") requested the highest dosage for Kennedy witnesses, and Doug hasn't come to terms, because he is a Kennedy witness, who has endured outpatient commitment in New York.  I was rapidly pacing around my parents house during the night, which is one of the torture side effects, and they couldn't lower the dose, because the neuroleptic had already activated the curare.  I was very careful, and I asked for drugs that weren't yet on the market.  I didn't know Ms. Trinity knew my famous private doctor, but she said she had mentioned Nizoral to my father as a doctor, and she wasn't allowed to take it; and so, everyone is holding out against me AND IT IS SO OUTRAGEOUS THEY DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE HURTING.  I personally run on the theory that what goes around comes around.  

To Dance with the Devil, by Dr. Susan Luve on NPR July 4, 2023.  The interesting part is a white man said to her, ""You'll send another man to Vietnam if you go to medical school,"" because they pit the interests against each other, the reason for grassroots analysis.",2023-07-04T21:00:34Z

Though it does occasionally have bouts of itching pain in its tail due to caning.

All in all, I'm proud of Singapore.  At this point (if they haven't already), if they just enshrined basic human rights such as the right to freedom of speech/expression and the right to keep and bear arms (you could take the US Bill of Rights, minus the Tenth since it's specific to the US, and you'd get most of them) into law, I'd be more than happy to say Singapore is THE best place to live in the world.",2023-06-26T22:29:20Z

Nevertheless, Singapore in the 1950s wasn't a festering city of slums, otherwise there wouldn't have been visitors like Somerset Maughan, Charles Chaplin and Ava Gardner coming to stay at the Raffles Hotel. We were still poor but not destitute. No worse than say London or Rome.

XSOgcpRbrCo,"I am a PhD and a businessman whose entire life from 1993-1997 has been shaped by Goh Chok Tong's admin . I migrated to Canada from SG in June 2020. I am going to ASEAN for multiple ventures for the next 20-25 years. I am a pioneer from Marsiling in Singapore because I started my life in the wafer Fabs in SG circa 1996 as a R & D engineers.

There is a not so small but a major challenge coming that will make opinionated persons  like Mahthir bin Md very nervous and forced to accept the inveitable. It will change the status of PSA  or Keppel docks. There is a massive major port coming to compete against SG and Port Klang its called the Great Nicobar port and the Government will spend INR75000 crore (USD9.1 Billion). Once the port comes into being the role of Singapore and Port Klang will be affected .  This port will have a capacity of 
16 Million TEUs - maybe Sir Henry Keppel Docks might eventually buy a stake in the port. 

You will not read about this in the AWSJ or SCMP but its a major fact of life. A transshipment port very close to Port Klang and having a presence in Malacca straits. Yes its now a three way compoetition for shipping containers and Oil and gas.

If they distribute condoms to students, soldiers and others and churches remain silent, they should not pray either, otherwise they are the worst enemies of Africa and that is what they are.

XSOgcpRbrCo,"14 The word of a prophet, it is God Himself who comes down through an angel and who speaks to mankind using a man called prophet. That is why, until the end of the world, like the prophets of the Bible, my words will never disappear because they are eternal words of God. Every prophet on the earth has had the same source of inspiration. To some, it was through visions or dreams. To others it was through audible voices from Heaven or through prophetic inspirations. Their Messages save the elect of their times and become a memorial for future generations. And some signs are given so that the earth may see and believe in them. And with William Branham, the crowd at the Ohio River saw this light and many fell to their knees and worshipped and others fainted. God did this so that America might believe. And at my birth, some angels’ singings were heard in the heaven and flames of fire appeared and the phenomenon was observed within a radius of three kilometers and the journal of the fiftieth anniversary of the assemblies of gods reported it.

15 A prophet is like a telephone. The words that you hear are not from himself. The telephone may be worthless and yet it can make the voice of the president of the republic heard. That is why you inhabitants of the earth, know that it is not me that you reject, but it is God that you reject. And you religious leaders, can a rabbi remain indifferent if he hears that there is a prophet in Israel? And in John 4, after the word of the Samaritan woman, did not all the rabbis run to the Lord Jesus? And I Kacou Philippe who speak to you, I am worthless before you and yet I am the door of the Heavens and the master of the harvest today.

XSOgcpRbrCo,"1 Like the prophets of the Bible, in April 1993, I, Kacou Philippe, a man who had never been in a church, I receive in a vision, the visitation of an Angel who commissions me for a Message destined to the whole earth in fulfillment of Matthew 25:6 and Revelation 12:14. This is the account of my conversion, as well as the three great visions of the call and commission as I received them: 

2 I came to conversion on April 24, 1993 according to Daniel 10:4 to 11 by a vision in which I saw myself standing on the sand of the sea and then on top of a high pyramid and then again on the sand of the sea in another place and I saw an old military truck coming out of the depths of the sea and leave behind me. I turned and I saw that it contained living people. They were women and one of them was mixed-race.

3 Then two doves came toward me and went back over the waters. And there was an eclipse, then a man having the appearance of a Cloud and holding a sword came down from Heaven with a Lamb and the earth was illuminated again. They stood on the waters and the Lamb began to speak to me in an unknown tongue. The sound of his voice came into me and I fell dead. My soul went to stand on the waters with them while my body was lying on the sand of the sea. When He had finished speaking to me, my soul came into me and I became alive again but I no longer saw Them.

4 Then a crowd of people came toward me from the right side and I asked them if they had seen the Angel and the Lamb. They said, ""No!"" And I said: “But, how did you not see the Angel and the Lamb and all the things They have done?” They replied, ""We have not seen the Angel and the Lamb and we have not heard the Words the Lamb pronounced, but we entirely believe It because what God gave and that the devil took, has now been restituted to you "". I looked up and I saw a ladder set up between the sky and the earth, above the waters and angels ascended and descended. And the vision ended and I felt what I know today to be the Holy Spirit and I wept and I believed in God on the spot. [Kc.64v3] [Kc.130v9]

5 The following day at around 3 p.m. while I was sitting with my family, I was transported again in vision into a totally desert country and I saw eastward Words that were coming down from Heaven carried on Clouds. It was after these two visions that I got up and went to church for the very first time. [Kc.137v37]

6 In a third vision, we were sitting in an examination room for the Advanced level test and the examiner was distributing the test-papers. I said to myself, ""But what am I doing here? I do not have a good school level and what am I going to write?” And later, It was said to me: ""The same way that Mary conceived miraculously, without knowing any man, the same way that Moses received in details what happened at the creation, you too, you have received the Words of eternal Life on this April 24, 1993 and it is decreed by God. At the appointed time, you will understand and you will teach what you did not learn in order that whoever believes has eternal Life"". [Kc.9v34] [Kc.30v1-3]",2023-05-11T20:25:04Z
XSOgcpRbrCo,"27 Each church has a demon that one can receive simply by believing the theology of that church or by letting its dignitaries lay hands upon him. That is why I forbid you from reading religious books, even if the content is true! The whole world is under the grip of divination, which makes them believe that they are in the truth with some prophecies and some speaking in tongues and some miracles, in order to accomplish what is said in 2 Thessalonians 2: ... according to the working of Satan in all power, signs and wonders of falsehood, in all deceit ... to them that perish, because they have not received the love of the truth that they might be saved. And for this reason God sends them a power of error, that they should believe what is false and that they should be condemned! [Kc.10v3]

XSOgcpRbrCo,"24 Now, I would like to say something: in the Bible there is first the prophet messenger and secondly the four ministries of Ephesians 4:11 that is to say apostle, church prophet, evangelist and teacher, and thirdly the nine gifts in 1 Corinthians 12 … Be attentive. There are three ministry’s stages: the gifts, the ministries in churches and the ministry of prophet messenger without whom there is no church on earth. If one of the gifts of 1 Corinthians 12 is acting in a church, this gift is for that local church alone and cannot be communicated elsewhere. Now if an apostle, a church prophet, an evangelist or a teacher preaches, that is for his country alone and cannot go outside of his country. Only a prophet messenger can preach for the whole mankind and like Noah, he is alone in his time. And you have to accept him to be saved. [Ed: The congregation says, ""Amen!""].

25 An apostle or teacher who gave an edifying preaching, that’s good but we cannot record it or write it or do anything so as to send it to another country. But now, know that the ministries are for the edification of all. And therefore, a brother can listen or have people listen to a preaching even from a preacher of another country. Wherever you are, know that this is the revelation of God that you must believe to be saved. [Ed: The congregation says, ""Amen!""].Acts 19:19. Know that if you are apostle, church prophet, evangelist or teacher when you try to write a book, you take directly the position of king Uzziah in 2 Chronicles 26:16, a king who wanted to burn incense to Jehovah while he did not have the right to do it.

But when the serpent came, it is towards her that he went. The serpent and Eve chatted for a while and tackled the subject of the sex sin in order to commit adultery with her. The serpent talked to her about sexual relation and they committed adultery, and blood flowed from before Eve and brought curse upon the earth. That is why it was blood that Abel presented and at the end of times, the Lord Jesus-Christ presented His own blood which is the most precious blood, and that blotted out the sin of all the elect from generation to generation, as well as mine, I, Prophet Kacou Philippe, that speak to you.

XSOgcpRbrCo,"1 … The Bible says that the Lord Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and to the ages to come. God and the prophets, the Church and the world; history is not but repeating itself. Israel comes back to God by the living prophet and returns to worldliness under the eyes of the priests, being themselves powerless before an infernal cycle, as old as the world. And on the other side, we can see the Church before the same fate, from father to son, from generation to generation, from age to age… That is as old as the world…

2 A generation comes with a new wave of seduction and God sends a prophet to reveal and overcome that seduction, and the prophet and his generation go past; then in the long run, a new generation of men rises on the earth and the same Satan comes back with a new system of seduction. Satan goes forth conquering and that he might conquer. And an angel goes out of the presence of God and comes against the attack of Satan. Exactly as we can see it in the seals. Amen!

3 A new horseman goes out of the presence of Satan, an angel also goes out of the presence of God to come and influence a man on earth! On the side of Satan, the instrument on earth, they are the priests, scribes, rabbis, pastors, pastoral schools, theological institutes, mission and ministry churches whereas on the other side, an angel goes out of the presence of God and comes and uses a man on earth, a prophet and his Message is the weapon of God’s children so as to overcome the ruse of Satan in their age, in their generation.

4 It is exactly what is going on in our generation as well. And our generation came up with the Internet that William Branham did not know and did not mention, not even once. And you can see that when Satan came in the Internet, Branhamists knew nothing about it and Satan seduced them so much so that, like David, they placed the Message of the evening time on that. And it is the Internet that was their evangelist. But Matthew 25:6 revealed that and in accordance with the grace I have received, I tell you that if William Branham were alive today, he would not do that. Never! … [Kc.10v46] [Kc.10v46]

5 Well, let’s take Genesis 31 now, I wish to read verses 22 to 32 and then I will read or then a brother will read verses 16 to 20 of chapter 35… I read: ""And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled. And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey, and overtook him on mount Gilead.  And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said to him, Take care thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. And Laban came up with Jacob; … And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast deceived me, and hast carried away my daughters as captives of war?  Why didst thou flee away covertly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have conducted thee with mirth and with songs, with tambour and with harp; and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now thou hast acted foolishly. It would be in the power of my hand to do you hurt; but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Take care that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.  And now that thou must needs be gone, because thou greatly longedst after thy father's house, why hast thou stolen my gods? And Jacob answered and said to Laban,… With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live. Before our brethren discern what is thine with me, and take it to thee. But Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them. "".  

6 Very well… Genesis 31… Now notice Rachel, this enchanting woman, she that Jacob loved… Sin is propitious where it is man’s love that expresses itself because the bases of that love will be carnal. But there where God has united or that the father has given in marriage of his own authority, there will be less defilement. What people call ""forced marriage"" in Africa was a good morality, a gift of God and a good sense that only the Word of God should cancel. You see?

7 Well, and the spirit of the forced marriage proposed Leah and man’s passion, behind which the perfect will of God hid this time, proposed the enchanting Rachel. 

8 Up to this day, Rachel has remained a reference in Israel and even Rachel’s tomb has remained a reference in Israel. She was buried before David and the kings at the place which would be the little Bethlehem one day, whence the Messiah would come out. She is not the mother of all the Jews and yet thus is she considered. And by the time of the massacre of children under Caesar Augustus the Bible could say in Matthew 2:17-18: ""Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremias the prophet, saying, A voice has been heard in Rama, weeping, and great lamentation: Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not."" Amen!

9 But the mystery is that it is behind this union apparently based on man’s passion that Joseph will come out, the saviour of Israel as also out of Bathsheba, the woman took away from Urijah, Solomon, the right hand of David, will come. It is thus a type of the living Church. And Leah is this Church who went forth after the seven prophetic times and Rachel is the continuation out of which Joseph, the male son before the pains of childbearing is to come. [Ed: The congregation says, ""Amen!""]

10 Of Rachel comes out he that was beaten and killed by his brothers. You see? Joseph is Jesus Christ and the male son. Joseph was, one day, sold as Judas was going to sell the Lord Jesus to the Egyptians of his time. While Joseph was in prison, in Genesis 40, the chief of the cup-bearers on Joseph’s right was saved and the chief of the bakers on his left was killed as on the cross, the robber on Jesus’ right was saved and he that was on his left was condemned. Always on the right! You see? As in Luke 1:11, Gabriel appeared to Zacharias on the right side of the altar. And in the vision of April 24, 1993, the great crowd came from the right side.

The Bhagavad-Gita can make you a pious Hindu, but to be saved, you are obliged to believe in the prophet that the living God will send in your time and I am this prophet, I that speak to you. At the judgment, when Noah appears, there will be those who will recognize him, those with whom he lived because he was their prophet. But will you recognize Mahomet? When Moses appears, there will be those who will recognize him, those with whom he lived because he was their prophet. And when I appear, you will recognize me because I am the prophet that God sent you and who lived with you. But will you recognize Mahomet? Today, you know my size, my shape, my voice, just as in the past, there were those who knew Moses’ size, voice, and shape; those who knew Mahomet’s size, shape, voice, those with whom they lived. But you have rejected me, the prophet that God has sent to you. And the same way I condemn you on the earth, I will condemn you before God and before his holy angels and before the prophets you claim to belong to.

XSOgcpRbrCo,"The ethnic Malays (Bumiputrahs) were a bare majority in their native land and were economically behind the non-indigenous Chinese and Indians who had come under the British colonial rule. The 75% of Singapore that was Chinese was the main target of the Bumis in peninsular Malaya. It required the 1965 divorce to calm things down, although anti-Chinese pogroms in Malaysia were still ahead. U.K. educated LKY was convinced of the necessity to emphasize speaking English for several reasons. Tiny S’pore’s polyglot population needed a common tongue, not mutually incomprehensible groups. S’pore had minimal resources and to prosper had to do business with the world in which English was the de facto international language. From his experience under the Empire and the Commonwealth, LKY knew books for higher education, especially in STEM, medicine, etc., but also travel & tourism books, were greatly in English. Compared to LKY blessing S’pore with this great language advantage, Malaysia shot itself in the foot. To give an advantage to the Bumi’s they went to an enforced emphasis on Malay (Bahasa Melayu) and let their English competence become iffy. Malaysia’s former tourists now were more comfortable staying in S’pore. Foreign business preferred dealing with English speakers in S’pore as middle man if they wanted anything from Malaysia. The Malaysian Ringgit that once was almost equal to the S’pore Dollar lost 50% of that value. Worst shock was when Malay speaking students wanted to go to university they found out the books, journals, equipment manuals, and international conferences were all in English. This wise language choice is one of the great legacies LKY left Singaporeans and is one reason for their wonderful country’s successes. Another main reason is the superb work ethic of Singaporeans, Chinese especially. And of course, in honesty and ethical behavior, Singapore is incomparably on a far higher level than places like Indonesia, Thailand, or the Philippines.

XSOgcpRbrCo,"Singapore was little more than a swamp when the British arrived to set up a trading post and a military base. It was barely populated, but for a seafaring nation, it had immense strategic importance due to it's position between India and China. It was to become the largest British base in that part of the world - even larger than their presence in Hong Kong or anywhere in India.

Once the English made their intentions clear, people started flocking to the area to set up shop. Most of them were Chinese, which made Singapore an ethnic Chinese enclave in a largely Malay region (which it still is). People survived either by providing support to the military base or to the huge port the British set up as a waypoint in the region.

Singapore's existing status as one of the world's most important ports traces back directly to the British presence there, which provided resources and protection for the cargo ships moving back and forth between China and Europe. Very little has changed - Singapore has more industry now and is a major exporter in the region, but it still serves as a middleman for trade between the region and the rest of the world. Its port facilities are ultra-modern and rival those anywhere in the developed world.",2023-05-01T20:18:06Z

It is scientifically not correct to pretend that mental health does not exist. When DSM 6 and DSM 7 evolve into existence, the previous standards of ""mental health"" may be considered wrong and crazy.

The founder of post-British Singapore was a biological victim of the earlier versions of DSM. Similar to Donald Trump, Putin and Xi. Baby boomers like myself were not allowed to think that emotions, sexual preferences and some behaviors were acceptable, like the earlier versions of DSM 5.

When the later versions of mental health and ICD 11 (International Classification of Diseases) exist, all the slaves of the previous international versions of mental and physical health will be considered ""strange"" and uneducated.

Those who live and lead by Truth will prosper together, while those who live by falsehood will cause suffering while gaining wealth and power only for themselves and ignoring the plights of others. 

Singapore is successful because the leaders chose truth over falsehood, it’s really that simple. While most other leaders chose falsehood and make millions suffer under them.
You need to be strong in order to choose truth. If not, you will bend and bow to evil and make lives suffer. The national color of Singapore is red and white. Red stands for power while white stands for purity. And all these years, the young descendant leaders continue with this tradition. It was the vision of LKY that set Singapore for what it is today. You cannot deny this. 

Truth is the universal conduct of life. When you live by truth, ultimately you will be blessed by the Divine. God helps those who help themselves. This is why Singapore can overcome so many obstacles to be so successful.",2023-03-05T04:26:43Z

They told me they had to travel to school on dirt roads with little street lamps. Fast forward by one generation, Singapore is now 100% urbanised. The exact same places where the villages were are filled with modern skyscrapers and apartment buildings.

XSOgcpRbrCo,"As an Australian visiting both these countries every year, I can tell that Singapore may have more income in terms of dollars and also an admirable standard of living. On the other hand, Malaysia has an extremely high-end lifestyle. If you ignore some corruption, the everyday routine is the world's best. 
Almost all Malaysians live in 3 or more-bedroom houses, with every adult owning a car. Eating out every day in good restaurants is always possible. We can also bring a house helper from a neighbouring country. Malaysia is also one of the very few places on earth where retirement is possible when one is 55 aged. If you also take into account, the year-round tropical weather and outstanding food, no western country can compete with Malaysia, let alone Singapore. 
Malaysia is home to tons of shopping and huge malls. They had built some of the world's biggest malls even in the 90s and much before the China boom. Malaysia is the only country I have seen, where most of the highways are highly beautified and landscaped, rather than just being a stretch of road. 

The work-life balance in Malaysia is at least 10 times better than in Singapore. The Ringitt was purposefully underrated as the country did not support the American allies, whereas Singapore's currency went up, just because they were outposts of the West. There was a time when the RM was rated higher than the S$. Yes, Malaysia is an openly racist country with a documented discrimination policy. But the Chinese and the Tamils (India) have accepted this and have been doing very well in businesses and private sector jobs. 

As additional information, in Singapore, the living cost is more than in most developed countries, especially the rentals.",2023-02-27T02:48:21Z

XSOgcpRbrCo,"Hubungan Israel –Singapura adalah hubungan luar negeri antara negara Israel dan Singapura. Hubungan antar kedua negara sangat erat, dan diketahui memiliki Hubungan Istimewa. Kedua negara membangun hubungan diplomatik sejak Mei 1969.
Singapura adalah satu dari 41 negara yang tidak ikut memberikan suara dalam Resolusi “Status Palestina dalam Perserikatan Bangsa-Bangsa”
Pada Januari 1968, sebelum hubungan diplomatik dimulai, Singapura membuat perjanjian untuk membeli 72 surplus tank AMX-13 dari Israel.[9]Pada akhir 1980an, Singapura telah membeli lebih dari 350 tank ini.
Pada 2013, total perdagangan Singapura - Israel mencapai S$1.956 milyar, melonjak 24.6% dari tahun ke tahun sejak 2012,
angka dari Kedutaan Besar Israel di Singapura dan IE Singapura. Singapura adalah negara pengimpor dari Israel, dan Israel mengekspor sebagian besar peralatan listrik ke Singapura, sementara itu Singapura mengekspor sebagian besar mesin dan peralatan komputer ke Israel.[8]
Pada 19 April 2016, Perdana Menteri Lee Lee Hsien Loong bisa-bisanya dengan enteng menjamu Benjamin Netanyahu dan kemudian berkata: ""Israel dan Singapura punya hubungan yang panjang dan lama. Tapi segalanya dimulai dengan hubungan (urusan) pertahanan. Angkatan Bersenjata Israel (IDF) membantu kami membangun Angkatan Bersenjata ketika negara-negara lain menolak membantu.""

2. Good grace and protection of the British empire, who used it as a strategic naval base linking the Pacific to the Indian ocean. Thus, with the British Empire's aid, Singapore is now a poster child of Capitalist Neo-liberal success. Singapore when it got its independence in 1965, and artificially separated from Malaysia WAS ALREADY A DEVELOPED AREA COURTESY OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE, AND NOT AN EMPTY SWAMP AND WASTELAND WHERE YOU HAVE TO START From SCRATCH.....THIS DIFFERENCE WAS NEGATIVELY MADE CLEAR TO ME IN DUBAI by a British guy, at a crude level in May 2002.

....then you have Myanmar, a former British colony.

3. The British allowed strong intelligent leaders to emerge in Singapore NATURALLY WITHOUT ANY ASSASSINATION OR JAIL. Dr. Lee Kwan Yu who made quite a few media appearances criticising the British, BEFORE AND AFTER INDEPENDENCE. The British wanted a competent leader to run Singapore. The Americans however relied on incompetent corrupt puppets in South Vietnam, due to the overt racism of the CIA and State Department.

XSOgcpRbrCo,malaysia poor? poor joke...,2023-02-08T15:07:22Z
XSOgcpRbrCo,"8:50 ""...rising social violence..."" Its quite telling that one of the most prominently mentioned (in our history books) violence in that era was the Hock Lee Bus riots instigated in 1954 by worker union(s), which led to the gov't forcing most unions to register under the gov't-affiliated Nat'l Trades Union Congress (rather than outright ban them as per 15:08), which would give the government, keen to attract foreign investment, more say over the unions (& probably a reason why industrial action is now rare here). If you asked for pay raises, you might get chastised for not being productive, & I heard that some workers who went on strike at our national airline were accused of treason & thus deported. Haven't heard of strikes being illegal (as per 15:07, unless you're in an essential industry, for which you need permission that I guess isn't readily given, as with permission for protests or firearms) but I heard that they can be considered a breach of employment contract. Many jobs that'd be unionized are also done by foreigners though e.g. migrant workers, who're legally banned from unions (probably as it might constitute political interference)
9:17 Correct me if necessary, but there also didn't seem to be as much resistance by the British to independence movements in Singapore & Mala ysia compared to in other colonies e.g. Kenya, where I heard massacres occurred, or in India where I read that a war of independence was fought. A possible reason was that the British wanted to fight the spread of Communism in the region, which was attracting supporters by offering independence as well. So the British's strategy might have been to allow non-Communist political parties to strive for independence instead & hope that the populace would support them instead of the Communists.
9:33 Had been thinking that if Singapore was already thinking of merging with Malaysia soon after gaining self-governance in 1959, why didn't it gain independence together with Malaya (western/peninsular Malaysia today) 2 years earlier instead?
11:23 Ah one reason that Lee Kwan Yew was relatively friendlier to then Indonesian leader Suharto was that he was less interested in & thus had ended the Malaysian-Indonesian Confrontation guerrilla warfare ( _Konfrontasi_ ) started by his predecessor in opposition against Singapore, Sabah & Sarawak merging with then Malaya (western/peninsular Malaysia today) to form Malaysia, instead of merging with Indonesia instead
11:48 Government supporters here tend to present security & liberty as a dichotomy - that if you want more freedom, then you're probably ungrateful for SIngapore's safety & security (which it does well in, partially because it works hard to stave off school dropouts I think). The sister of our current PM even used the Newtown, CT school shooting in 2012 to argue that the USA has less freedom from gun crime than us, & thus it is hypocritical to express serious concern about Yale opening a liberal arts college here. 
Political censorship is sometimes more discreet here, such as a law requiring state-linked companies e.g. DBS to own stakes in our national newspapers, who would be keen not to ""rock the boat"", while the state's investment company has stakes in all our telecom companies. Journalists from foreign news outlets have also reportedly been less likely to be allowed entry into the press box of our Parliament than those from local news outlets (who might be more supportive of the gov't), with security guards reportedly lying that there is a ""lack of space""
& I only learnt more recently that capital punishment here can be applicable to kidnapping too, which would up the stakes in some occasions e.g. when a private-hire driver was accused by his passenger in 2019 of 'kidnapping' her because he took a different route to her destination
Actually some government supporters are even more hardline that the government itself, which says that its exercising its constitutional right to clear its name when launching lawsuits against critics. Meanwhile I've seen their supporters even call for critics to be imprisoned (on websites like SGHardTruth), accusing them of dividing our society (which seems like a more superficial approach to me though)
Also, what do you'll think of our minister's comment when responding to complaints that capital punishment catches only the drug mules/couriers but not the kingpins? He said something like ""Well that means that the kingpins are already deterred from entering the country. Mission accomplished""
12:38 One of my countrymen called us to be more grateful soon after accusations arose of phantom votes in Malaysia during its 2013 elections, with people there questioning how the ruling coalition there still managed to win a small majority of legislative seats with a majority of the popular vote. Actually however the statistics are even more skewed in Singapore, with our ruling party still managing to win 83/93 seats in our Parliament despite having only 61% of the popular vote, not because of fraud, but because under our election policy, many seats here are contested collectively, & winner takes all (irregardless of how small the winning margin is). Singaporeans probably won't have as much of an issue with this I guess due to the country's prosperity.
12:46 Indeed Singapore's PAP has leapfrogged neighbouring Malaysia's BN political coalition into 3rd place among the world's longest-serving governments, having done so since 1959, behind only mainland China & N Korea
16:00 I'd say Singapore is easy to do business in in some ways (e.g. low corporate taxes, simpler tax code, unions that're friendly to companies & the gov't) & less so in others e.g. small local market, especially as local consumers sometimes prefer more well-established brands, which're more likely to be foreign competitors to local businesses e.g. Apple's iPod vs Creative
16:57 I'd say Singapore had even more consequential policies on public health e.g. extra PE classes for overweight students, whom in some schools were restricted on what they could eat in the canteen too. Conscription is practiced for men too, with additional PT for you if you score less than a certain amount in the annual physical fitness test",2023-02-08T14:34:58Z

Yes Malaysia is not a poor country by a general metric, but comparatively to Singapore, most if not all SEA countries can be considered poor by comparison, even compared to the largest economy in SEA, like Indonesia.

People keep using GDP per capita, average wage or even the country's debt as a metric for comparison, no one uses that to measure a country's wealth or economic strength. GDP per capita only measures how wealth is distributed in a country, same with salary, no one uses that to measure how rich a country is. China is the largest economy and one of the biggest economic power in the world, but they have notoriously bad GDP per capita and average salary. And what does debt has to do with anything? US has a multitude higher national debt than any other country in the world to date, and they're the wealthiest country in the world, what are you people talking about I don't get it.

XSOgcpRbrCo,"This comment is coming off my head...! 

Singapore became rich because it capitalised its  strategic shipping position..!

Since Malaysia  ejected Singapore.., the 1st thing Lee Kusn Yew did was  to work with Japan  & USA...!

THE STRAITS OF MALACCA HAS BEEN THE  BUSIEST SHIPPING  LANE SINCE LIKE FOREVER...!

The ship in 1960's & 70's needed constant refuelling and supplies...!

Singapore  made a hugh  monopoly deal with the American Navy...!

Later, American & Japanese Co's  were invited to built factories in Singapore which will save them on freight charges and cheaper labour & manufacturing cost...!

To entice these companies, Singapore declares thr Island as an 'Entreport""..!

(1) Unlike Malaysia . SINGAPORE  used all their  nations brains and also got many from Malaysia... ; while Malaysia was (with Dr. M involved in politics and brain washing the leaders) discriminating against those  A++ students from ALL races...!
(2)  Unlike Malaysia & Indonesia who did NOT capitalise their privileged  position with regards the Straits of Malacca...!
Singapore had no serious competitors...!
(3) Umlike Malaysia & Indonesia, Singapore  fought nail & tooth against Corruption...!

While Singapore was  marshelling   all its citizens from various races & religion..,  Malaysia was up to its neck, playing racial politics...!

In short, part of Singapore's success story is possible because of the failures in Indonesia and in particular Malaysia...!

""FINDERS KEEPERS LOSERS WEEPERS...!

THE above Narratives are between 1963-1990's... &  yet only Indonesia is learning from the bitter lessons today ...!

TODAY,  SINGAPORE'S HOLD A SUBSTANTIAL REAL ESTATE, PLANTATIONS, BUSINESSES AND STOCKS  IN  MALAYSIA & INDONESIA...!
Its made worse with  such a high  currency  exchange rate and  high standard of living...!

Downsides living in Singapore:
1. Expensive like Hong Kong and Tokyo.
2. 5 million people on a hot humid island with buildings. Urban heat island effect.
3. Competitive school system. Similar to Chinese Gaokao, Korean, or Japanese school entrance exams. Singaporean kids get stressed out at school and are forced to learn calculus at Secondary School (Aka Middle School). Western schools don't do it until high school. Political discussion about opposition parties and politics is non-existent in textbooks. They don't want people opposing the dominant Peoples Action Party (PAP) founded by Lee Kuan Yew who have been in power since 1965.
4. No drugs, porn, and prostitution. But prostitution is still lurking around. Heavy censorship of media. Straits Times is managed by the ex-government official like a Chinese business. Media is owned by the state owned Mediacorp: Channel 5 (English) and Channel 8 (Chinese) news. Porn is illegal and blocked. The police WILL go after you if you have smuggle it in. Protest illegal unless you are licensed by government to speak in speakers corner which no one cares. Opposition parties are fined and jailed so they don't ever win. PAP makes sure opposition look stupid.
5. Mandatory military service for all males due to the threat from bigger neighbors (Aka. Malaysia and Indonesia).
6. Increasing Xenophobia for foreigners due to lack of housing space for everyone. Prices have been rising leading to cramp apartments like the Hong Kong situation.
7. Raising inequality. More homeless on the streets.
8. Central Provident Fund not sustainable.
9. More Flash Floods. Raising water levels. Singapore is at sea level. They need land reclamation otherwise they sink.
10. Han Chinese Singaporean majority. Good luck if you are the minority. Constant reports of abuse of domestic workers from Indonesia and Phillipines. Low accommodations for Indian construction workers. Alot of Singapore's labor workforce is foreign and lowly paid and poorly treated.

In fact, all cities / small countries / colonies / overseas territories in comparable situations are also wealthy: Panama, Gibraltar, New York, Rotterdam, London, Dubai, Shanghai, (and in older days Istanbul, Venice or Genoa) are all trading hubs of some sort.

So yeah, UMNO was the party which broke the promise - and their alliance won 0 seats in the 1963 GE.

XSOgcpRbrCo,"It's hard to reconcile Singapore's success had it existed where the Falkland Islands are now. In other words, although strategically vulnerable from invasion from a hostile Asian power (such as happened in 1942), Singapore position is one of the best placed to capitalise on international trade and shipping routes. That helps enormously. Lee Kuan Yew is the most interesting despot in recent human history because his oppression of free speech was not driven by his desires to line his pockets (and those with all his families and associates as well). Resisting this obvious temptation puts him way ahead ethically of many other dictators. Furthermore, unlike the one-party state CCP, the virtual one party PAP is driven by pragmatic market-driven authoritarianism and not by failed Marxist ideology. I understand the social and race frictions and riots that periodically broke out in Singapore before the 1980's that may have lead to Lee's repression to control this, and relative lack of democracy in Singapore. It seems to me that Singapore's development has somewhat mirrored that of Taiwan, albeit that Taiwan is in a more perilous strategic condition than Singapore is now. This was not always the case, and may not be into the future. The global trade system that dominated the globe by the US Navy protection of everyone's trade's routes for 40 years is by now breaking down. This puts increasing pressure on a small trade-oriented countries like Singapore to beef up it's navy and air force to protect it's sea lanes. Without regional concourse, particularly with Malaysia and Indonesia, Singapore may find an unpleasant competitive arms build-up and increasing friction with it's near neighbours, and of course with CCP China which is increasingly becoming belligerent in the region.",2022-09-22T08:00:15Z

XSOgcpRbrCo,"Lee's knack was to get ordinary Singaporeans to trust him and his agenda, while being saavy enough to know how much he could get away with in terms of less savoury practices. Like heavy handed control over the media, detaining political prisoners without trial, nobbling opposition parties, and ensuring a ""compliant judiciary"". These methods were accepted at a time when people were more pre-occupied with earning a living, getting a roof over their heads or avoiding race riots. They are less likely to be accepted by Singaporeans today, most of whom have grown up with full bellies and a more educated world view. It will be interesting to see how durable a legacy Lee has passed on to his successors.

XSOgcpRbrCo,"Lee Kuan Yew, is a perfect example of what you would call a Wise Dictator. He did not rule in a dictatorship for the sake of power, but for the benefit of the signaporian  people and their future and took the necessary measures to implement that. 

Under a wise Dictator, you can do wonders. But under a bad Dictator, they will make it like a hell on earth. 

He was a Unicorn, or the exception to the rule. While he was great and has led Signapore into what it is today and has brought great prosperity. He is a exception to the rule not the norm. The thing with Dictators is that you can't pick the good from the bad, and you can't guarantee they won't become corrupt with power, because greed is naturally in human nature. While he was great for the people there are no Assurances his successors will be the same. It only takes one bad Dictator to severely hurt the nation. It's the same problem the old Absolute Monarchy system, under a good king you had peace and prosperity. But under a bad one, you probably had hell on earth. 

That's what makes a Democratic form of government so great, it assumes you can't completely trust its leadership, so before a leader could really damage the country too much you can easily replace them. It mitigates the risk, but it does mitigate a bit of the potential gains under a good leader too though. But in most instances of Autocratic rule, generally they are more bad than good.",2022-09-20T03:59:17Z

So you think that before the reforms in the 50s, people had more freedom ? When you are poor, how can you be free ? Singapore is now rich with a high ppp and their people have freedom to spend, travel and live however they like. Rich or poor, you still need laws to protect individual freedoms on infringing on other peoples freedoms. Freedom of speech must also be weighed against the freedom of those who want to listen, meaning you can't just shout anything or print anything that is against what some people want to hear otherwise it will harm the growth of society. So LKYs laws were not restricting freedoms but setting out a framework with clear parameters on how freedoms could be expressed for maximisation of societal growth. ie. whats the point of arguing for the sake of arguing.

XSOgcpRbrCo,"An internal policy analysis sadly misses the macro geopolitical forces aspect distorting Singapore's development narrative significantly. 

During 1965-75, the US offered significant economic assistance to stabilise Singapore as a key segment of their containment of communism during the Cold War, and Singapore's economy, rather than Malaysia, industrialised through providing repair and transshipment facilities for US forces in Vietnam. Helpful to support an underdog in the region as it will remain dependent.

This has changed in recent years as Singapore is unwilling to repay the loan as it was initially a ploey by the USA to rule them in secret. Singapore is now getting much more support from china and the ISLAMic world, so it is slowly lose its interest in being an American ""puppet state"".

The majority of Singaporeans lived in Kampongs, not slums. But of course, LKY categorized them as slums on purpose. Many older Singaporeans value and hold fond memories of Kampong life, and they tell me its a pity that the younger generation would never get to experience what Kampong life was like. 

At independence in 1965, Singapore's GDP per capita was $517, many times higher than many of these countries: South Korea at $108, China at $97, Thailand at $138, Burma at $17, Taiwan at $225.

XSOgcpRbrCo,"It may have been shocking to see a nation eject part of itself and forcibly give it 'independence'. But on hindsight, this act should be done more often to reduce the number of internal conflicts that would have torn the entire country apart. The reason for Singapore's ejection was because  Lee Kuan Yew, the leader of Singapore which was a Malaysian state that had a large Chinese population wanted more equal rights for all the races in entire the country Malaysia, whereas the majority Malay population wanted to retain their special position being the natives of that country. Apart from the Malays and the Chinese, there were also a significant Indian population in Malaysia. Dragging it out could have resulted in a civil war like you see in so many countries all over the world. As it was there were already several racial riots in that country during those days in which many were killed. Today Malaysia and Singapore live peacefully with one another as neighbors with close social and economic cooperation rather than a squabbling family under one roof. Other countries should learn from this. This is not rocket science. If a married couple can't get along, then just get divorce and follow your own path.

XSOgcpRbrCo,"People say Singapore's story is one of a miracle....I will disagree.
Here is why....
Singapore was expelled...

Singapore has a strategic location in southeast Asia and in the World....

Singapore had no natural resources...

Singapore shouldn't exist....

Singapore is generally homogeneous....(if there was a competing ethnic group that could challenge the dominant Chinese Singaporeans....the story would be different)...

Singapore and their leadership knew they would die if nothing concrete or substantial was done......

Singaporeans knew the only way was up....

Singapore had great leadership....

Singaporeans and the world knew their success in this world wouldn't be as a result of less corruption or anything else we like to attribute but rather a general understanding that in order to take advantage of location and time.......they had to fight and create an economy and environment that accommodates corruption but at a barest minimum and with education and innovative ideas of getting investment from the West, southeast Asian countries and now China.
A miracle didn't happen but I really understand why we call it a miracle because the nation was small and had a lot of odds against it.....but history tells us small nations too can  succeed...and a good number of small nations did succeed.
This nation was always destined to succeed if not then, it would have been now. 
Location, time, access(with or without natural resources), strategic international relations, neutrality in foreign affairs, education, ethnic homogenity and strong/stable politics or leadership are key and all were on the table for this small nation and they got it right on one attempt........ miracles can't create these qualities, Destiny does.",2022-09-15T20:03:06Z

2) it fought hard to catch the wave of the economic growth (this was not luck, it was out of effort and sacrifice from the people at the time, and in the scheme of things economic waves happen all the time in different forms and industries depending on how you look at it), 
and 3) it only got lucky in having LKY leading it at that time (where he could have easily been ""more corrupted"" with power to the detriment of the country, and we got lucky that he had acted with great foresight, principles/integrity, and decisiveness). 

And also while LKY deserves much of the credit, the focus on him tends to overlook the other brilliant work done by other individuals, public agencies, and private citizens and businesses.

And yeah, Malaysia definitely has its issues in that regard, enshrining Islam and ""Malay-ness"" in its constitution and the entire shitshow that is the NEP.

Separation are a sad thing but in this case it's different, it's for their best. I can assure you 100% if let say, Singapore is still in Malaysia today, it still wouldn't change anything about Malaysia. It would totally be a different Singapore from what you see now.

For the outsiders be it Europeans, Americans, Arabs, East Asians, Indians, stop putting the blame on Malaysia like ""Oh they kicked out Singapore, why they do that, they shouldn't do it, now look at them"" okay?

My first impression as I reached the Singapore end of the courseway and I noticed the sparkling clean waters on either side of the entrance. As I went into Singapore, I noticed lots of trees lining the roads. Flower plants on all the overhead bridges. Many high rise apartments and buildings. No rubbish to be found anywhere. I stayed in Kartong Hotel. I visited Senthosa Island and saw  the historical Japanese museum. There was a musical fountain and an aromatic flower garden. I return by cable car and watched many ships below. From the seafront, I saw hundreds of ships. I visited the zoological garden and had snaps taken with a giant snake and also with and Orang Hutan. I visited all Singapore and it was very exciting and adventures. I am an admirer of Mr Lee Kuan Yew 🥰",2022-09-13T11:41:29Z

There was always the lies and false accusations initiated by Opposition politicians first. You need to speak to some employed singaporeans.,2022-09-13T08:18:48Z
XSOgcpRbrCo,"Hard Truths:
1) Singapore wasn’t “kicked out”. LKY engineered the independence by openly supporting the political opponents of Tunku Abdul Rahman (the man without whom Singapore would remained a British colony) thus making Singapore’s position in Malaysia untenable. LKY made his crocodile tears announcement on TV of Singapore’s independence before Tunku had actually signed the deed of separation. All this is evidenced in the Hansard.

2) The fact that some of those political opponents LKY supported were pro-communist (and the PAP being a recently-communist party before LKY engineered the sacking of its leaders and assumed control) only further inflamed the Malayans who spilled blood defending their new country against communist insurgents in the north. The friend of my enemy can’t be my friend.

3) a sleepy village third world country Singapore was not. It was the jewel of the British crown colonies, had a robust civil service and sophisticated infrastructure and the region’s most developed ports. Singapore had the 3rd largest GDP in Asia after WWII. LKY basically inherited the good work of his predecessors and claimed it as his own doing. 

4) Here’s what Singapore got from its supposedly “hostile neighbour” since independence:
- a free airline (MSA > SIA) and a monopoly on international routes 
- endless supply of cheap sand, water and labour, without which none of its much vaunted success would have been achieved 
- ZERO threats despite Singapore’s military arming itself to the teeth and openly practicing war games

But Singapore needs its boogeyman Malaysia to keep its citizens in fear. 

5) Singapore is the last country on earth that has not changed its government. The only others are North Korea, China and Cuba.

6) It also has the world’s highest MP:electorate ratio. This plus the world’s only electoral system that requires constituents to elect 5 member teams instead of individual representatives means that its political hegemony is ensured in perpetuity.

7) no other country practices state capitalism quite like Singapore. Public housing, transport, healthcare and utilities are provided at grossly inflated prices to provide bumper profits to state-owned corporations. 

8) The rules are always tilted to favour the rich. Singapore launders everyone’s money. 

9) LKY openly advocated state sponsored eugenics. Women were sterilised to reduce birth rates. LKY then used the low birth rates to justify importing foreigners and new citizens by the millions to reduce the native-born population. You know who else favoured eugenics? Hitler. 

10) LKY is but one man. Like Gandhi, Washington or Churchill, every country needs one leader to propel the country forward. A great man perhaps, but his creation is a perfect veneer that masks giant social and economic fissures.",2022-09-13T08:14:15Z

They have no rights set for them, almost no way for them to seek greivences, and they get treated so poorly. The Singaporean model is a deception and is as flawed as many other nations. Foreigners just don't usually see or understand that side and of the course it's not advertised; they censor just as much as China does. I have been there once, during my time in the US Navy and I know some Filipinos who went there for work and I've heard how bad their treatment is.

XSOgcpRbrCo,"to everyone that kept saying Malaysia must’ve regretted separating from Singapore let me tell u the full story. because Malaysia had to unite with 2 poor and big state, Sabah and Sarawak,they needed more money to make sure those states are stable. this is because those 2 states are really left behind and needed to be upgraded. so the government borrowed money from Singapore to make sure those things can happen. Singapore was already rich even though when it was in Malaysia. but when the government borrowed money, Lee Kuan Yew wanted more power and wanted to tax the borrowed money. Secondly, he wanted all citizen to have the same rights, which was to abolished the special rights by the Malay. this of course angered the Malays in the country. Thus, the current Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tungku Abdul Rahman held a meeting with Singapore and other high ranking ministers to discuss the matter. unfortunately, Lee Kuan Yew didn’t accept the agreement. This made the ministers proposed an idea where Singapore is seperated from Malaysia so both nations can have what they wanted. Malaysia get to keep their laws intact and Singapore a sovereign country.

We did not regret separating from Singapore because if we didn’t, a civil war may have happened. and Tungku even said even though seperated both nations would still work together and it is still happening till this day. Singapore and Malaysia still depend on each other. the seperation was something that had to happen. both parties got benefits.",2022-09-13T07:22:43Z

XSOgcpRbrCo,"as a singaporean, thank you for so accurately representing our history. This is by far the best video i have watched by any international source about singapore, and the way you've shown that singapore has been flawed, it was for good reason, and worked in the context of singapore alone. also, unions WERE banned, but now there is a union, called NTUC. it runs a large supermarket chain (and also it's nationalised lmao). 

you also have to consider the problems that our superior healthcare has caused: our rapidly aging population means there's an even larger emphasis on healthcare, and a large percentage of our population are not in the working class. this has sparked policies of re-employment of the older generation, and also, implementation of various employment policies which prioritise singaporeans (TAFEP). our lack of land has lead to reclamation efforts doubling down (with the building of terminal 5 of the changi airport, we'll have the first airport built on reclaimed land). speaking about the airport, the changi airport has been one of the best (if not the best) in the world for many many years. the emphasis on education has created a draconian curriculum, that while competitive, has increased adolescent stress and depression rates exponentially. An estimated 50% of all Singaporean teens are suffering from depression, largely due to the highly rigorous and demanding curriculum. 

singapore is an incredibly multifaceted society which has been forced to walk the tightrope since the very beginning, in the context of the cold war when it gained independence. it traded with the soviet union, rejected western influence, (so it could join the UN, and maintain US interest in the region) and formed ASEAN (to gain an equal say in the region, prevent the vastly larger Indonesia from gaining unparalleled power within SEA) in order to maintain its fragile sovereignty, and it would not have been possible without LKY.",2022-09-11T09:27:28Z
XSOgcpRbrCo,"well I cannot comprehend the audacity to call Singapore as “poor” in 1960s..

Yes the slum was there, but there was also extremely rich merchants and businessmen already living there. Singapore already hosts many lucrative businesses which many rich Southeast Asian looked up to.

Back in 1960s, many rich Indonesian families were  already travelling to Singapore to seek medical treatments. And the entertainment industry was big in Singapore back in 1960s, many Indonesian and Malaysian artists went to Singapore to record their studio albums. Southeast Asian movie industry was relied on Singapore business of film processing industry.

Not to mention those “ports” were already there and bustling for quite sometimes. Many of goods sold in Eastern Part of Sumatra back in 1960s were relied on Singaporean distibution centers.

Yes, the financial industry and high tech industry are quite “recent”. But Singapore has always been the trading ports and good at finding “industry-specialization” im which its neighbor never even thinking off. Thus, it is always in “higher income” territory even back in 1960s at least in comparison with many Asian countries.",2022-09-11T08:40:29Z

XSOgcpRbrCo,"9:06 Take note, Singapore did not put their faith in LKY first. They put it in David Marshall first. But the British did not trust him as he was a Jew and hence he did not deliver the results of self determination for Singapore in 1955. The final nail in the coffin came when one of his ministers pocketed some of the sale of Christmas Island to Australia when he was the CM. The Workers Party lost the election in 1957 and never won another till 1981.

10:34 The official reason was the Communists. Malaysia has violent Communists and they blamed Singapore for it.

15:08 Not true about foreign investments, low taxes and low regulations.  That came only in the 80s, with exceptions to regulations, which we still have, just that it is crystal clear.

XSOgcpRbrCo,"A very good effort at covering Singapore's history, although your value-laden judgment did leak through your narrative. But that is understandable. The problem with narrating history is that knowing what we know now, we are tempted and seduced into thinking that the past was working towards a predetermined future. So it is tempting to assume that Lee Kuan Yew aimed to get Singapore rich, and was ruthless (and unprincipled?) in his self-appointed task of prospering Singapore, and that everything he did was to achieve that goal. That is a fallacious assumption. 
If I could ask LKY a question, my question would be, ""why?"" Why did he choose to try to lead Singapore. He was a lawyer, trained in England, and could, if he wanted, worked there as a lawyer. There was nothing to hold him in Singapore. There was not even an idea of ""Singapore"" as a city-state. Before 1963, he returned to a post-war Singapore devastated by the Japanese Occupation (that part of the video was very emotive and evocative!) The British had returned (to try to make amends for their betrayal?) and sought to re-establish some semblence of order and civilisation. But they were a waning power and couldn't wait to have an excuse to pull out of Singapore. 
Lee believed in the (conventional) wisdom that Singapore could not survive on its own and worked desperately towards merger with Malaysia.  And when that did not work out, and Singapore separated from Malaysia, Lee cried on TV.
At that point, he could have just thrown in the towel, pack his bags and leave for the UK to be the lawyer he trained to be. Why didn't he? 
Instead, he ""decided"" he wanted to stay in Singapore and be the dictator that many western ""scholars"" see him to be? :-) If Singapore had gold, diamonds, oil or other natural resources that he could steal and exploit, maybe (curse of natural resources). We had (back then) hungry people, disease, heat, humidity, and unemployment. For me, that is the more interesting question.
BUT... I did not mean to be... petty. This is a pretty well-researched narrative, and for a non-Singaporean, quite objective. I don't agree with some of what you said/conclude/judged, but that is only human. And there are lots of nuances and side issues (e.g. comparing HK and Singapore's housing). I can't help but smile when you noted that Singapore had ""affordable housing"", and can imagine the hordes of Singaporeans who will crucify you for that (I am not one of them, tho!). :-)

What's more interesting is not just this, we have had numerous cases of great leaders leading economic miracle on for their work to crumble soon after they die. One interesting way the Singapore ruling faction holds itself and various other members accountable is tying their success long term with Singapore long term success. Their stake in government owned investment funds directly related to how well they were managing their job. This is almost similar to paying employees in company shares, but a little more complicated with many strings tied. Then, there's the transition. Singapore went from a manufacturing, port hub to a strong financial centre due to circumstance. Singapore was rich and stable throughout the turbulent years compare to their neighbours. Much of their wealth were generated then reinvest through government held hedge fund. These funds were then invested into businesses around, from plantation to real estate in their neighbours. They went in with money to rising economies like China, Vietnam then Burma which bore fruit until this very day. That's how they managed to transform from a manufacturer to an investor so successfully. Their model is essentially what China had adopted since the 80s.",2022-09-10T14:16:14Z

This ran counter to the then popular idea that international trade merely exploited third world countries.

Secondly I don't think he at any time banned Unions completely. He just severely legally restricted when debilitating strikes could take place.

And become rich because this small country has a become place for corupt money to escape from its neighboring countries arround asean/sea(south east asia)
Especially the most corruptor from Indonesia who save money in Singapore bank
There are corruptor from official and big businessman
Also become very rich so that it a become a vacation spot for rich people from neighboring
The rich man likes to spend money in Singapore just to enjoy luxury things
Such as luxury hotels/property, shoping for european luxury branded goods, and luxury gambling and casinos
So basically Singapore's economic model is a mix of Switzerland and Monaco
Where Monaco is luxury vacation spot for  the rich in europe

I've always been curious about Singapore's situation and how it worked out for them, but never been able to find more than a dry economic accounting; nothing that addressed the circumstances around it, or at least that did so as succinctly as you have here.
