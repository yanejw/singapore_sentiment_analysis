XDYy8z7krAI,"Having lived and worked in a number of countries, I find that the working environment in Singapore is perhaps the most stressful that I have encountered. The concept of ""meritocracy"" has morphed into an unhealthy expectation by employers that employees must do more than they need to. In most government jobs and many local corporate entities, this has led to a bloating of the workload by introducing the need to quantify productivity by some arbitrary ""proof"" measured by the number of tasks completed. This has the negative impact of introducing tasks that are created just so that ""work"" appears to have been done, even if many of those tasks do not actually contribute to the achieving the required goal. This micromanagement and obsession to document every single task leads to a very inefficient system of work management that wastes an enormous amount of time and effort that could have been directed to actual productive activities. The other great stumbling block is that the corporate culture frowns upon any attempt to streamline the workflow as being ""militant"" unless the suggestion comes from persons who are in upper management. This stifles the workforce's creativity and deprives the employer's of the full potential of its employees. In truth, this rigidity serves only to hamper many corporations' ability to quickly adapt to any changes in the local and global business environment. It is a pity that this work ethic has become so ingrained because there are so many talented people who have so much to contribute to any business, and has led to a large number of young and talented people leaving the country for job opportunities abroad, something that the government has never acknowledged.",2023-07-21T12:40:17Z

My mother was a teacher and she eventually quit because of the extreme overwork. She couldn`t take care of us as she had too much work to complete and little time to rest. The education system is not that good. It is a filtering system to sieve out students not to encourage them to pursue their dreams. What do you expect if you keep drilling and grilling students with PSLE exams which other countries do not have. Singapore education results is high because the PISA rankings capture only 15 years old and Singapore is again the only country that does standardised tests for 11 and 12 year olds to sieve them. There is a shadow tuition industry. Quality is not good as the distinctions of subjects at national exams O and A-levels are never released; only percent passes.

Most locals did   Budget shopping across the border in Malaysia as most high street stores were for the rich, expats or tourists. Also one thing that really hit me that almost every upper middle class child seemed to have a trinity diploma in piano or ballet and yet Singapore was never known for a world class pianist or ballet artist.

But, there is a problem I find common in Asian education systems. There is a tendency to learn and repeat. That process is easy to assess in form of grades. But it not what education is all about. Knowledge in, not only a deeper sense, but a creative sense includes thinking, questioning - and sometimes the process ends there. We just don't know. We have to push the limits of understanding. I find Asian craftsmen and workers to be extremely resourceful and innovative. But academics - not as much. In the west it's the other way around. Our education systems are not effective. But they produce original thinkers who can help pushing the frontiers of science forward. Our industries...well if you can replace ten guys with one robot, that job wasn't that creative, was it?.. It's all done at the drawing board. The work force is less involved.

What is the dark side of Singapore? It is the story of a group of politicians who don't know how to develop a country; merely good at acting that they know. This is the other word that you failed to highlight. Above kiasuism is wayang. People here act only. Don't really know what they are doing.

XDYy8z7krAI,"Watching this video curiously reminded me of an introductory book to anthropology I read once. The field of anthropology, as a serious study of science was born when fieldwork was enshrined as a central component of the field. Before then, studies were built upon second-hand sources without ever travelling and living among the subjects. And however meticulously and impartially this was done, the early proto-anthropologists could match-up to the down-and-dirty work employed today. 
These condensed youtube explainers had me thinking: this must be how proto-anthropology would have looked like! Most things are right, but not quite right. The arguments seem asynchronous, the present and long forgotten mixed together uncomfortably (those TV ads have looooong since been retired!) Important context is omitted, not for lack of rigour or care, but just from not having lived through the life.
For example, the whole housing situation is poor represented, from the segue from cost of living to presenting private housing first (when in reality ~80% of housing is public and private housing is mostly an afterthought to the average resident). Singapore has some of the lowest median homeownership cost to median salary ratio, around 4.5 years' worth of salary per home. This beats out every other metropolis in its weight class like NY, Beijing, Tokyo, Sydney, HK etc., which average 7~8 years, going as high as 20+ years in the case of HK. Singapore has the second highest PPP adjusted GDP per capita among cities/regions, which can serve as a rough proxy for material standard of living. Even if the costs-of-living rises, it remains one of the cheapest metropolises in the world. This is without mentioning how Singapore's generally just being so on the ball with their macro; unemployment has already been moderated to pre-covid levels and inflation is much more subdued than other developed peers (an impressive feat considering how much inflation is imported!)
The political tensions are also misrepresented. Singaporeans have a very high level of trust in the government and public institutions (per Edelman's 2021 report). And while difficult to find comparable datasets, I do not feel that xenophobia is rising. Anecdotally, it has probably experienced little change, if not a gradual decline. 
The discourse presented on education also has slight flaws. It's unreasonable to cite the high level of stress while also demonizing streaming. It does present glaring problems of equity, but where is the fairer alternative? Should weaker students be forced to undergo the most rigorous curriculum (likely inducing greater stress), or the best students the lowest baseline? Perhaps Singapore streams too early on in life. That is a fair argument to make but ignore extremely important context. Singapore's top schools secondary and pre-U institutions are all public (and very cheap) unlike many other countries including the US. It is not like American students get an equal secondary school education. They may take an entrance test to a private school and pay an exorbitant fee for it anyways. In this way, the social streaming is more opaque and less equitable. National exams far from level the playing field, but it is a significant attempt. Furthermore, in revamping the national secondary school entrance exam from a precise point-based system to a grade letter system, the government is taking great lengths to shift the public messaging, taking steps to shift away from its previous ethos of hard work above all. And it must be reiterated that the public education system at all levels is generally very scrutinized and well-funded, especially compared countries like the US where municipals or counties fund their schools and positive feedback loops of poor districts begetting underfunded schools and further poverty are at risk of developing.
Overall, I still think this is a good video, well researched and well produced. But it is impossible to really present a holistic picture without fieldwork in such a short format. There is an argument that when these reductive youtube explainers take on an anthropological aspect and represent foreign cultures and peoples, they are more offensive and distasteful than usual, and this video suffers accordingly.",2022-12-30T16:31:29Z

XDYy8z7krAI,"Singaporean here, there's also the point of priority given to foreigners instead of locals in terms of job preferences, and its really easy to get PR as the government takes the easy way of recruiting new citizens... instead of fixing base problems that is causing the population crisis. With the influx of new citizens comes friction, as most of these foreigners are from wealthy backgrounds and have a socio-economic advantage which is reamplified again with them taking high paying jobs that locals can do, and do better. 

Secondly, the culture of working is still very backwards, most organisations are resistant to change and are unable to adapt to flexible working policies.

There is also the problem of the ageing population - there has been a recruitment boom for people to work in Social Service Agencies, but the pay for these roles are ridiciously low. I'm a uni grad with a double degree in Sociology with Psychology from a local uni, and my pay is not even 4k... and I have 10 years of work experience. Been working in this role for almost 2 years. In contrast with our ministers saying that SSA workers can earn ""decent"" pay, my current can't support a family so how do I start one? I am aware I can get a job with much higher pay with my qualifications - this is a small spiritual journey for me before i move on to something larger. But think of the people who fill these roles for the long term. We cannot attract locals to fill these roles due to both the monetary and mental stress, placing these roles in the hands of migrant workers, increasing our reliance on them. 

Now this is not about xenophobia - i am perfectly fine with migrant workers, but if we do not fix the underlying issues, we are akin to an engine running out of gas. At this stage i would advise our younger generation to think of an exit strategy for their own sakes.

There are issues in the nation that needs addressing along with the wage gap, and with many uncertain factors on the horizon, i am doubtful we will be able to emerge from the next 2 decades intact as a respectable society.

XDYy8z7krAI,"As someone who finished another round of national exams (streaming) not too long ago, I too realised the sheer amount of pressure my classmates were under. Due to the new AL system which is mathematically unrewarding and rewards all-rounders, DSA has also been highly competitive with only ~5% of applicants getting a space. (Yes lots of statistical analysis between T-score (where marks of 4 core subjects are summed and multiplied by 0.73) and AL (where your score for a subject is translated to a number from 1-8 and called your AL and then the ALs for the 4 subjects are summed for the total AL. The system is unrewarding as the AL mark bands are marginal close to the top.
AL1:90% and higher
AL2: 85%-89%
AL3: 80%-84%
AL4: 75%-79%
AL5: 65%-75%
AL6: 45%-65%
AL7: 20%-44%
AL8: <20%
Statistically this ""less stress"" system is designed to reward all-rounders and people who take HMT. By being wide at the top, then having the margins get thinner, there is no point getting more than 90%. So it is better to have your marks close to each other, instead of the previous system where the average Mark's dictates your final score.

Many of the passengers would just close their eyes pretending to be asleep. I guess that is the result of a competitive society, where you either swim or drown and no one will help you. I have never seen the kind of callousness that I saw in Singapore. It is really a robotic, non feeling, zonbie society, from the top (the government, the ministers etc.) to the bottom (the hawkers on the streets).

I did not start good in Singapore, due to some family issues I lived in china untill I am Primary 3 and due another family issue I was sent back to Singapore again.

I did not receive any English class in china thus I cannot understand anything on primary school until P4-5, failing every subject except for Chinese. Consequently Did super bad on ‚ÄúPSLE‚Äù(As mentioned in the video, this exam put you to different streams) went in one of the secondary with the minimum entry requirement 

Now you probably think I will rant about the system but actually I am very satisfied with my time there, even though the school is a sort of ‚Äògangsta‚Äô community school the Teachers there are still very responsible and effective. You can definitely do well if you have the determination for it the school will assist you with your learning. But do be noted that as a lower stream you will receive lesser resources from the school compared to others and even be labelled as dumb and hopeless but the resources you get is completely enough for you to get yourself together and climb back up.

In Secondary 2 students are given a chance to go to a better stream if they get 75% and above for end of year exam(I got 74% sadly) and proceed to take on O-level just like the rest. Even if you failed to do that you can still choose to go for PFP(A program that grant you access to poly with N-level result at the cost of one extra year) and secondary 5(to take O-level) there is at least 3 chances for you to leave your current stream and hop to better one.

The million dollar (SGD, NOT USD) public housings are either huge by local standards (almost twice the size) or placed in very attractive areas in downtown in a premium development. 
In either case, its a very bad data point to make a point and results in a cherry picked argument.

It is true that the locals are resenting foreign workers. My experience is that it is mostly towards CECA workers from low income countries, who come do the hard manual work at a very low rate.
This leaves the locals ""trapped"", where some jobs are simply unavailble. Management positions (in foreign companies) are predominantly held by foreign talens (highly skilled people from overseas), labourous jobs are taken by eg. Bangladeshi.

The low fertility rate is not uncommon in highly developed nations. Its particularly poor in SG because public housing is largely unavailable if you are not married.. and due to above, most singaporeans have to get a university degree to get a decent income. Men also have to do 2 years of duty that delay their ambitions.

XDYy8z7krAI,"ok I watch this video again. Kiasu means afraid of losing out. This word surprisingly made it into modern English vocabulary and can be found in dictionary. It is a recent inclusion. The word is from chinese dialects, Teochew and Hokkien.  Part of the reason for the inclusion into English vocabulary I guess is due to Singapore being an ex-colony of the British empire. I guess the Brits want to always have some links with its sphere of former influence. The English language has always included some french words and is the opposite of latin which is said to be a dead language. The English language is the language of international commerce. Eventhough Singapore gained independence, but it is still part of the Commonwealth, and the Queen was the head of the commonwealth. Now it is the King. A singh caught onto the idea of Kiasuism and commercialise on it, commisioning a comic book out of it. In the comic, the boss is a Mr Singh,  Mr Kiasu is a typical young Singaporean jobber who is like a clown. This clown has a cousin called Kiasi which translate to be a coward.  This is the typical sidekick of the main character, and Mr Singh is a remote character who makes cameo appearances. The comic was popular with the local people, and there was commercial element to it. Basically, kiasu is a behaviour that is prevalent in all humans of the world. One cannot say we Singaporeans started it. It is seen in animal group behaviors too, if we observe animal during feeding time. so it is very ancient. 
Competition is the driving force of kiasu-ism. Yes, children go through the selection process which is very crude by todays' standards, selecting elites out of the lot. These elites are often send for some  international math olympiads or spelling bee contests and often gets first placing. The latest was some show in UK of a young Singaporean guy who has mega-memory. He has knowledge of many trivial facts on geography. 
Now China is showing even more extreme kiasu-ism on many aspects. why because Competition within the mainland is always on a higher notch. This is the same with Europe , and USA. They too have it within themselves. Singapore is technically a small island, although within the Asia land mass. Singapore is the 2nd most densely populated country in the world after Monaco, but not the most dense cities. HongKong have probably higher density, and Hongkongers are known to be hardworking and extremely competitive that Singapore's kiasu-ism would be a laughingstock to them, and then what? They have to come here to be global citizens of the world. The competition in Mainland is the reason. The CCP of China is showing extreme kiasu-ism in brutalism, along with all the PRCs currently in China. It is life and death matters right now in China. People are put in extreme conditions of being deprived of food ! That bit of kiasuism may means survival or death. 
ok back to Singapore's kiasu-ism. So we have it from young. Into National service where we are like the Russians conscripts right now. Out to the working world, get a wife, start a family, get a house. It is probably planned from cradle to grave. yes it is. The life we live. Kiasuism is conditioned into us to compete for allocation for public housing. If you go along the flow of government planning, one can reap some rebates or discounts along the way, BUT at some disadvantages that is inherent to the process. People are getting married for the housing discounts rather than due to natural pairing. This social engineering which probably is very traditional to chinese culture. The generations before us, marriage was by matchmaking.",2022-10-25T02:48:37Z

They will always put the people who are better in the subject first before yourself no matter how much you like that subject. As a very average student interested in art and not too worried about things like biology and additional maths, I am shunned by many people and they say that I should be taking pure subjects instead of wasting my time on art. They keep telling me that anyone who chooses to take art in secondary 3 is out of their mind or are stupid. Yes I am burnt out. There is always that thought at the back of my mind that I have to be good in at least one subject, I have to get an A in this subject, I need to be best at this subject. Not only to please teachers or parents, but also to please myself. The education system is truly tiring and competitive, it‚Äôs always about how well you do that determines your strength as a leader sometimes as well. I lost count of how many nights of sleep I lost preparing for exams and to know that I won‚Äôt be one of those prioritised for that specific subject after working so hard because my score is average, it just hurts to be honest.

It is so well hidden that we are not knowing the extent of it. The current Image that the gov people are trying to sell is Singapore is a very rich country in the world. This is all virtual money. They are trying to attract the richest people to come to Singapore, and they are trying to attract talents with a lot of Capitals. This is a sure sign that corruption will increase. Recently, some Virtual currency foreign entrepreneurs have setup business and suddenly gone bust. These people are just laundering people's money somehow. The police probably didn't find anything abnormal, because these businesses are related to commercial affairs, or overseas clients, and probably  too complex for the Corruption department. Nobody complain. Next, China is having some very abnormal incidents that are surprisingly not reported by major new media. Videos don't lie. News censorship in China is obviously everyone knows ,but the various international new media are not reporting major happenings in China ! There is a known forced emigration of the very rich people in China. and they come to Singapore , some with questionable sources of assets. Singapore gov is welcoming ""talents"", as they call them. Just opened a special scheme to facilitate the process. Houses just become smaller size and yet more expensive following HongKong's popular property Capitalistic model.  Lots of Hongkongers now have become new Singaporeans. China's pressure of Taiwanese has also force some Taiwanese to come here, as well as the western expats who have been living in HK, Taiwan and China for the previous decades.

This is a more arduous task if we have scholarships to maintain since not all of us are well off enough to pay the exorbitant fees institutions charge. Families can't spend much time with each other because of hectic work culture and it has a domino effect on the whole of society. When a child doesn't get the attention they deserve because mommy and daddy are too busy providing for the family and otherwise, how will this affect society in the long run?

Singapore often compares itself to KL or Jakarta or Bangkok when it really needs to be looking at switzerland or London.

I disagree that I didn't think it was as cut throat or stressful as some other countries where tests are much harder and the stress of getting near-perfect scores is really high as only the very top percentile get the best schools (eg. school in India). But it is true that Singapore's overall system can create only good employees in white collar jobs, not true innovation. For that, you need boldness and bravery, a mind that is free and not smothered, looking with interest at the world and necessarily having little respect for authority. This is not possible when the government is literally squeezing you from every side with rules, regulating what you think and do not think with state newspapers and hold values and beliefs they want you to hold with massive repetition in schools.",2022-10-19T20:02:10Z

As many have already pointed out, there is no perfect country and Singapore has been largely on the right track which is already much much better than many other countries. 
I don't perceive ""Kiasuism"" as a negative trait or as a derogatory term always used by our neighbor(no prize for guessing whoüòâ). Kiasuism is the reason how Singapore got to where it is today. Hard work from our ancestors all in pursuit of a better life for the next generation. Mind you that they work hard(especially the pioneer generation) knowing that they likely won't see the fruit from the seeds they planted when they were young before they die. The fruits are being enjoyed by the next generation. I can see the same happening now as well albeit in smaller scale.

They are becoming lazy because the generation taking over now was born into a luxury and relaxed life, they don't have the work ethics of the founding fathers and they are becoming more resistant towards bringing in immigrants who at one point contributed a lot towards their growth. It's always the third generation when things go down hell. Allowing immigrants in is the only solution to keep the wheel spinning because immigrants will replenish the low birth rates and they will come to Singapore with the mentality of the first generation, they will work tirelessly to earn the life they have moved from their home countries to achieve.",2022-10-13T03:56:25Z

This in turn necessitates a continuous influx of foreigners to fill up these spaces, by renting or selling as overpriced ""safe deposit boxes"". Only a minority of local elites are able to benefit from this node of development. 

More than 80% of the local population lives in public housings, although, which is of very good standards, it is the relative feeling of being in a lower strata that's causing the unease. There's a feeling that now, instead of the past colonial masters, it has become the wealthy or supposedly more ""talented"" foreigners that are living in the nice and expensive houses. Although standard of living and income seemingly have been raised, many are still slaves to decades long public housing mortgages and high costs of living. And with real wages effectively being stagnant for a long time, this  culminated into the current state of unhappiness and stress.

XDYy8z7krAI,"As a Singaporean born and bred, there's always 2 sides to the coin. Sure, we are not as liberal compared to some Western democracies but I'm glad that our govt doesn't copy wholesale from foreign governments because it simply won't work in Singapore due to our mixture of different race, religion and culture within, not to mention that we're surrounded by neighbours who may pick fault with us if we stand out too much from the rest of the ASEAN nations. 

Singapore Government recognises the housing issue and is willing to introduce market cooling measures. Unlike Hong Kong, young Singaporeans have more realistic chance of ""owning"" public housing because we're required to contribute certain percentage of our monthly wages into CPF which can then be used to pay for a variety of essentials such as housing loans, medical and school fees, similar to how social securities work in Western countries I assume. The key here is to live within your means and don't get smart by flipping public housing properties unless you are very sure about what you're getting into. 

Compare to some of our ASEAN neighbours, corruption and crime rate is very low in Singapore as authorities come down hard on perpetuators, giving people and investors confidence to set up businesses in Singapore which in turn offer job opportunities. Public infrastructures are well planned and public transport works well 98% of the time in my humble opinion. Bottomline: things generally work the way you expect them to be in Singapore. Some Singaporeans take these conveniences for granted because they've probably never step foot outside the country for extended period of time. 

In terms of population, most of our forefathers were immigrants from all parts of the work and I think SG government will not hesitate to bring in foreigners en mass if our birth rate continues to fall, since human workforce is vital for Singapore's progress. This by itself is worrying for Singaporeans, but the giant wheels of Singapore Incorporated will not stop simply because of our reluctance to comply. Our strong currency and relatively high quality of life in ASEAN means most ASEAN citizens are willing to work here and hopefully take roots in Singapore. The challenge is how will the SG government cultivate a sense of belonging and loyalty among these new citizens so that they won't run away at the first sign of trouble should Singapore gets drawn into any global disputes. 

My complaint is that there's no soul to Singapore because everything looks glossy and man-made. We don't have the luxury of countries like Japan or Korea where the population is more homogenous because they have centuries of cultural grounding. Change is the only constant in Singapore and if Singaporeans don't catch up, then we'll easily become obsolete on regional and global stages. In life there will always be trade-offs.

But Singapore is just an island a little bigger than 700 square kilometers. Reclaim as much land as you want but it's not going to make much of a difference. 

Once we reach the limit and we can't import more foreign talents, the economy will start to decline. 

The surprising thing is that people from the region are still eager to take up citizenship completely clueless as to what is happening.

Mixed in terms of student achievement, because weaker students have no role model to aspire to in their track. Moreover, it destroys the self-esteem of weak students as early as Primary 5 (Year 5). Hence, where possible, avoid between class streaming. The low fertility rate is not due to stress alone. Parents are living much longer, which often requires financial support, either monthly ""contributions"" or large medical bills. Then there is expensive housing, and car is out of question for the young (a sedan now costs $150,000). Childcare is also expensive. But all is not lost.

XDYy8z7krAI,"As a Singaporean student, what you have to say about our social & economic situation is a fairly accurate representation of what's going on. When quantity and quality of work is the #1 thing in society & your life, people will inevitably forsake other pursuits like having a family. The overworking is certainly a major cause for concern, my mother used to work for a Bank of China branch, working hours lasted until 10 - 11pm from 8am. I remember my teachers in primary school telling the class how they stayed up till 3am in the morning marking our work, barely getting any sleep for lessons the next day. The country doesn't have a lot of land either, so housing is difficult especially with a growing population due to massive immigration. There's bits of discrimination against immigrants, especially those who come from China and India since they are the most prominent, but I don't discriminate when they come in because my ancestors came from China, and I know Indian friends whose families have been here since Independence, we're all stuck in a stressful situation together and bigotry will only result in unnecessary strife. Lee Kuan Yew's vision was fruitful and the people did receive the benefits, but when you progress so fast, you'll lose the older generations.

If in singapore, population growth play a very important role in economy which means more birth rate = better economic growth, in my country, it is the purchase power related to domestic market growth.

XDYy8z7krAI,"I feel like I just attended an opposition rally! 
The best way to vote in Singapore, is with your feet. Of course there are lots of niggling little problems. And yes, there are parents who have voted with their feet, leaving Singapore for a country with less stressful education system because they believe that is best for their child/children. But there are also parents who chose Singapore for themselves and their children. 
And while I facetiously suggested people ""vote with their feet"", the reality is that if you do not have a marketable skill, it is very hard to be accepted as an immigrant in another country. 
So the question is, if you are a Singaporeans with no unique or marketable skill that would open doors for you in other countries, and are doomed to stay in Singapore, can you make a reasonable living? Are your children doomed to be stressed out in a ""pre-rat race"" even before they start work? Are they then doomed to run the rat race, and engage in kiasuness, just so that they can buy an overpriced flat and breed like rabbits at the govt's prodding?
