Some turn to drugs because : (1) Due to bad company and vices that entice them through peer pressure (2) Due to broken family and not able to seek help & counseling (3) Unable to deal / manage and cope with stress arising from studies or work and unnoticed by teachers and parents (4) lack of family love & spiritual peace with oneself.  Hope such drug addicts should seek help from loved ones and professional rehabilitation centers. As for drug traffickers, they are aware of the consequences and should be dealt with by the law.
