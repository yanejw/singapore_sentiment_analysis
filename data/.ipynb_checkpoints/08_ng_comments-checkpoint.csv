xi6r3hZe5Tg,"That's all nice but I just put a high-end refrigerator directly next to my bed.  It's facing me with just enough space to fully open the doors.  All I have to do is slightly stretch my arm while laying down.  Now where is my documentary?  I've done other great things.  I have a Corvette in my living room.  And Marshall half stacks in every room in my house.  I even have fifty guitars in a huge furnished barn with my pianos, giant geodes, geological specimen, and even two nice cars on lifts in the attached garage.  It's like a museum and show worthy.  Mostly because the refrigerator thing, though.",2023-08-02T15:56:38Z

xi6r3hZe5Tg,"Singapore is very efficient and decisive when making strategic decisions, e.g. it  adopted English as its tuition and working language after it was founded as English is the undoubted world language. You can see a lot of other Eastern countries wasting a lot money and energy to learn English, it succeeded training its citizens as bilinguals. It also adopted Simply Chinese characters as the China (huge population )use it. It was sad that HKer were forced to learn Mandarin and gradually lost their English heritage otherwise they may also use English as their working language.",2023-07-01T05:37:05Z

xi6r3hZe5Tg,"10 The devil has given men other marks of beauty. And yet according to the Bible, the mark of beauty is the face. We see the case of Rebecca in Genesis 24:16, the case of Sarah, Abraham's wife in Genesis 12:11, the case of Rachel in Genesis 29:17, the case of Abigail in 1 Samuel 25: 3, The case of Tamar in 2 Samuel 14:27 ... But the devil has invented other marks: the buttocks, then the navel, then the complexion then the makeup, and so on. This is a challenge to the divine perfection: a way to say that ""God should do things in such a way"". The fate of Jezebel is reserved for you. A divine hand seized dogs to eat your great-grandmother Jezebel. And what happened with Jezebel? The dogs did not touch the skull, the feet and the palms of her hands because of the makeup and the nail polishes. My very dear Sisters, God wants to see you as He created you. Stay so!

I live in South Africa, where copper wire is prime commodity. And our power supply is regularly cut for days on end because the power lines have been stolen!! That's to say if the whole power plant functions at all, because essential parts that contains copper hasn't been stripped or otherwise sabotaged!! All I can think of is that their taxes must be insanely high, even higher than our insanely high taxes, which is being stolen by government officials faster than it comes in!! How do they do it??

They sell soil, sand, and mineral mines by the highest price they can image but the lowest price by educated Singaporean.

Our leaders have failed to take into account that while the population grows geometrically the food supply can increase only arithmetically.  And such geometric increase will stress the planet beyond its capacity to support us........  Look at all the cars, one for every family, pumping out pollutants in ever increasing amounts, and each family seeking to eat meat, which is already causing distress in the clearing of the Amazon Basin of trees and other vegetation.......  We seem oblivious to the possible annihilation of our species!

Curious how the humans can be so intelligent in some areas but simply can't put it together in others, or else they are simply blindly overly optimistic........  How long will the contention over global warming and population growth continue?  We actually seem to thrive on disagreement, which in fact may be our Achilles heel......

IN VEDAS
OLDEST HINDU SCRIPTURES 

Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) is mentioned in oldest religious books of Hindu as Kalki Avtar(کلکی اوتار) -- last prophet. 

The Vedas are 4000 years old according to Hindu scholars of Vedas. 

A hindu professor of Hindu university of Varansi made it very clear in his book on Kalki Avtar refering  to the  Vedas. 

He clearly told the Hindus that 
they should accept Islam and follow the Kalki Avtar step by step. 

The details mentioned in Hindu's 
scriptures are astonishing/ amazing. We do not find so much details in any other religious scriptures like Bible.
What is the real source of these details? Who could have  told all these facts 4000 years ago . 

Indeed not other than a
prophet. Who is that prophet? 
This prophet  may be Noah(pbuh).

He is the oldest prophet mentioned in Torah, Bible and Qur'an.
Hindus know Mano. Who is this Mano ( منو )؟ May be Noah.
Allah knows best.

There is always someone better after your job, some other company trying to destroy yours.  If you get a good business running, it is tempting to run it 7 days a week.  The money can be good.  Taxes are low.  The time will come when you will yearn for less crowds and more wide open spaces and your own space, and this city living will become a pleasant curse.

Notwithstanding the multi-cultural presence, they still act as one single unit in the preservation and protection of its people through advance technological, biological and cultural aspects. Kudos to the government and the people of Singapore!   Unlike my country Philippines, the biggest thieves are the ones who are supposed to help the people, the ones who wears elegant clothing to be called honorable with their long standing entourages, the ones who like to be called by their position and affiliation. Needless to say, we have much more mineral resources in general to exploit upon. And what more shamefully embarrassing is that this has been going on for decades now. Tsk tsk..",2020-09-07T11:04:18Z

xi6r3hZe5Tg,"The success of Singapore comes from the democracy in flag but China's Confucian civilization in nature. The Covid-19 is a examiner of the quality of the civilization is humanized or not.

Maybe, due to the unbearable torture of seeing increasingly people are sacrificing to the novel coronavirus simply due to the ignorant social governance; in Apr. 12, 2020, the editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News, Dr. John Micklethwait and the political editor of the Economist, Dr. Adrian Wooldridge jointly published article The Virus Should Wake Up the West to despaired sigh: “The job of government is to protect its citizens. The pandemic reveals that key institutions in Europe and the U.S. are no longer up to the job.”

   ""Since Hobbes’s time, the world has come full circle. When he wrote “Leviathan,” China rather than Europe was the center of administrative excellence. China was the world’s most powerful country with the world’s biggest city (Beijing had more than a million inhabitants), the world’s mightiest navy and the world’s most sophisticated civil service, peopled by scholar-mandarins who were selected from across a vast empire by rigorous examinations.”

   ""Indeed, it was the struggle for mastery in Europe that propelled Western government forward: Europe’s monarchies seized on technological innovations — particularly new ships and weapons — to improve their chances of survival. When the Chinese invented gunpowder they used it for fireworks; Europeans used it to blow one another (and then the Chinese) out of the water.”

   ""The West’s governmental advantage is now questionable: Simply ask yourself whether you would feel safer today in New York and London or in Singapore and Seoul? Asia is catching up with the West, and in some smaller countries has overtaken it, in large part because Confucian Asia in particular has taken government seriously over the past few decades while the West has allowed it to ossify.”

   Clearly, the two outstanding media professionals angrily pronounced that the civilization of the West is inhuman play of struggle for mastery by blowing one another out of the water. While the self proud of electoral democracy is not acted as that of the ""rule of the people"" or the ""rule of the majority"" at all, but it is the typical dictatorship of the inhuman low quality individuals in clown show without sense that how to create a peaceful life for their people; instead made people, themselves and their families of all lost feeling of safety.",2020-09-03T15:35:09Z

xi6r3hZe5Tg,A thought nothing technical but if we can heat salt with the sun and mirrors we can create steam to pump into the atmosphere with the same process effectively creating rain or collect condensation and filter that may be slightly cheaper than desalination as the heat will drive turbines and create condensation moisture to use for at least use as grey water at this stage. Moving this water through a mixture of rock and soil will make it pure enough for consumption. Possibly!,2020-08-25T07:26:58Z

xi6r3hZe5Tg,"When Donald trump made a trip to singapore, it was just a formality. None were interested in his presence here. We, the citizens were aware. And he couldn't accept that fact. Compare that with the presence in Singapore of any president or Minister for example from Britain, or Australia, or any other country. We've done Guard of Honour during my military service with true devotion, before my retirement from the force.. But for trump it was clear it was never even half hearted. Formalities. My next generation knows donald trumpeter's wrong character. . Hence we strive to keep moving forward. We Singaporeans have made it so far but nothing is easy. Immigrant applicants are far too many. Aplenty. Emigrants are few, and most regret.The vision by senior Mr Lee was beautiful but maybe he didn't even expect it to keep moving like this. Right governance. Exact opposite of donald duck trump administration. 
We, here, continue to strive, in the right direction for all of us. 

From Singapore, with love.

What a horrible way to live, produce grown in factories, glad I won't be around to see this.  Also, reclaiming land-what about rising sea levels? Reducing green areas to make the way for factories, horrible.  What about all the carbon that is created to create the factories and various materials to  such food?

I am proud to be Singaporean (in a humble way) and the amazing feats we have achieved thus far while we continue to push the boundaries of possibilities to surpass previous milestones.

While I understand the fierce need to innovate for a small country like Singapore, I do not think the results can be replicated in larger nations like the US, at least not so quickly and smoothly. Singapore's GDP per capita can sustain mass innovation and the expensive futuristic infrastructure, but other nations are still deprieved in more traditional problems like poverty and access to basic needs. For those types of nations, commitment to a similar development as a Singapore would be both ineffective and damaging. Plus, a lot of things I saw in the documentary were present merely for decorative purposes, which is an imperative cause of the depletion of resources.",2020-04-19T19:34:27Z

Even after attaining a decent standard of living, Singapore realized we must NOT rest on our laurels. Others can see what we have achieved and implement similar policies - as China did, and witness THAT achievement.


Live in peace and harmony both within your borders and with your neighbors. Help out when a neighbor calls for it. 


NEVER practise ""Beggar-thy-neighbor"" policies.


An idiot like Trump tries to enter politics ? We sent him to Reform School at the age of 6 and imprisoned him for life - at age 18. 


Our system or politics is not perfect; during our early years, Western Journalists and Media tried to lecture us on freedom of speech and human rights. Those same Media folks are languishing in ""free"" Australia, ""free"" USA, ""free"" Hong Kong, ""free"" Britain, etc, .

xi6r3hZe5Tg,"All this planning looks great but it also looks very expensive. With a poverty rate between 12.7 and 14 percent, Singapore's poor population continue on the increase and the most affected are the elderly. What is going to happen is similar to what is happening in many cities in the US like San Francisco, Miami Beach and New York. The cities become too expensive for the poor and the poor are the ones holding the low pay jobs that keep the city running.  It is interesting that the poverty rate in singapore continues to increase while in the US, the 12,2% poverty rate is decreasing. One of the reasons, in my opinion, is that Singapore has a significant shortage of space and when that happens, Real Estate becomes very expensive. In the US, poverty is more spread and there is still room to develop low cost Real Estate.",2019-12-20T23:21:57Z

xi6r3hZe5Tg,Theres a difference in how people are brought up in the east vs the west. Here in the west it's all about following your heart and living your dream or what you think is your dream and might make you happy. In the east you are prepared from a young age to survive and excel in society and it's a shame if you dont. The western approach definitely has some merit. Though theres a limit to it. I'd say theres definitely a reason why Singapore is where it is today.,2019-11-18T04:54:15Z

xi6r3hZe5Tg,"A very important aspect of Singapore that enabled us to do all this (which was understandably not touched in this documentary at all) is our political nature. The ability to plan 40-50 years ahead is thanks to our political stability and prudent government. It's really not difficult to do all the things shown here technological wise but because of conflicting and equal political forces existing in other nations such that their governments are always in a political gridlock resulting in stagnation or worse, even regression of progress made, means what Singapore can do cannot be easily replicated especially in those countries where their political ideology differs from ours; for example, USA's presidents can at most be elected twice for a total of 8 years, and where both political parties are equally strong such that policies get implemented and then get dismantled or even blocked for majority of the 8 years like Obama's presidency, resulting in a government whose perspectives are extremely short term, couple that with powerful lobbies that works not for the people's interest and you just can't plan ahead and do what Singapore or even China could because of the political stronghold and stability we have, regardless of whether you think that's a bad thing or not (""real"" democracy means nothing if it impedes on progress and USA, being the epitome of democracy is now just a sham).",2019-06-02T08:59:05Z

its waste of time and money going to Singapore there are interesting places but not better than India, as there are only building available and it looks like a robotic country and any country can develop if the country is small and with less people to controll.
  I can bet you India is better and best than Singapore food is expensive water is expensive they don't have their own water supply they have to borrow from Malaysia and Singapore talk about cleanliness  I have seen many places with waste garbage and cigarettes are there on the street if you buy a 1 litre water bottle in India which is of 20 RS  and if you buy in Singapore it will cost you 75 RS .
how we can say it's a develop country ,
where we don't get water for free even in a normal restaurant ,
The person who have posted the video has showed you the good side  of the country and its looking attractive because of  a good camera ,
as every one look good if the camera quality is good the picture will come nice if you  really want to know how it is than go and visit the country ,
trust me you will say India is better and best than Singapore and even we should not compare because it's a very small country size of Bangalore 
You  must be thinking that on a video it look so good I have a video of India which look better than this it's because of the camera if you want to know more about it will share you the video and you check and compare....",2019-03-25T07:15:27Z

xi6r3hZe5Tg,Singapore is legit city goals,2019-01-19T19:02:00Z
xi6r3hZe5Tg,"It might be useful to inform commentators below that Singapore scores very low on almost every accepted measure of democracy. No media or newspapers exist without the express permission of the government. There is NO FREE PRESS in Singapore. Public expressions of any anti government opinions are not just banned but criminalised. Punishments for trivial offences are harsh. The death penalty exists. Singapore is undeniably run efficiently, but only for those who unquestioningly accept all government planning, and are obedient to every government dictat. There is almost no opposition in Singapore. It is in all but name a fascist government. Its financial management is reliant upon elitist monetary and fiscal policies that are essentially a house of cards. At some point it will reach peak population, peak building and extremely unequal wealth distribution and the cards will collapse. It has a veneer of fairness but underneath it is the Monaco of the East. For the time being it is true that if you join into the illusion and are totally obedient to the regime, you might do quite well, as long as you never question anything. The problems arise when so many people crammed into such a tiny space begin to realise that they do not live in a Utopia, but a Dystopia masquerading as something different. This film is of course a PR exercise. If you want to visit Singapore and observe just the surface, you can be duped into thinking it is a marvellous example of a successful nation, but dig just a tiny bit below the surface and you will see that things are not quite so perfect. Some of the comments below are staggeringly naive.",2019-01-18T22:02:52Z

xi6r3hZe5Tg,"It's important to take notice that what underlies and supplies the funding for all this public and private research is capitalism. Singapore ranks consistently as the second most economically free nation in the world. The government does a superb job in protecting property rights, facilitating free trade, and keeping the overall regulatory burden low while still enforcing pollution control guidelines. It is so remarkable to see what can happen in a ""start up culture"" such as Singapore, where people have the freedom to innovate.

xi6r3hZe5Tg,"FORWARD PLANNING has always been in Singapore's DNA.  I migrated overseas because I have a strong dislike for human learning through disciplinary systems but we should give credits where it's due.  Dr. LEE Kuan Yew, Founder of majority-chinese Singapore, merged with Malaysia (or Malaya then) as he was hedging his bet on Independence from the majority-Muslim Malaya against the British colony.  He then called Singapore a multicultural city and instituted English as 1st Language (and not our Mother Tongue whether you are Chinese, Malay or Indian) in order to mitigate racial unrest while surrounded by Muslim countries.  Dr. LEE also knew the island was blessed with very deep harbours and a strategic location to world trade.  The journey began with the world's busiest sea port; than one of the busiest air ports; created a powerhouse financial hub; kept up by transactional outsourcing for conglomerates; pushing through integrated resorts (think Marina Bay Sands); and built the largest off-shore LNG storage and transformation facility.   Drone delivery, urban commercial farming and large-scale wireless electricity transmission are almost akin to passe concepts as these prototypes are being put to production in other parts of the world.  I am nit-picking here - this particular episode seem to lack in-depth discovery of the island's planning modus operandus for its ageing population, in particular, care for the Elderly.  I would appreciate more info in this area.",2018-12-15T07:24:03Z

xi6r3hZe5Tg,"I’ve been to Singapore as a tourist this year and found the country to be litter free. The country is quite modern, with lots of pockets of green space amongst the urbanised sections. I found the people to be calm, collected and courteous. The fact that people do not litter explains to me that Singaporeans are proud people who care about their well being and their surroundings. There are many aspects of innovation and technology that india can learn from and adopt. 
Fundamentally,  because Singapore is a very small country in terms of available space, they have become innovative and economical in their development without harming the natural environmental surroundings.
I also believe Singaporean people are economical and  budgeting visionaries like Indians who are able to create and make something from nothing but ideas, imagination, trial and error to reach their goal.
I would somebody like to go back to Singapore and spend more time in the country. A beautiful country with forward thinking people, where different cultures live side by side to give a collective effort for the good of their country.",2018-12-02T14:04:56Z

The governments response was more like an ""oh well"". They fixed the bridge but little was said as to why a single crash brought down a bridge in the way that it did. Fortunately, no on died when this happened, but it makes one wonder is that what it will take; a bridge collapsing without there being an earthquake and people dying. Sad, but that is probably what it will take before they act. America has always been basically a reactive and not a proactive country.",2018-12-01T18:33:41Z

xi6r3hZe5Tg,"I believe the main reason why Singapore was able to achieve what we have today is due to us having a flawed democracy. Our opposition are in a small minority thus the ruling party can make long term plans (10 to 50 years) instead of planning only for the next election as they are not restrict by a 4 or 5 years term thus time is not wasted on political or policy U-turn. With this, our politicians can spend less time playing the ""house of cards"" game and focus on building the country for the good of the majority. The question now is we do not have any natural resources and we can't grow gold or oil thus the only resource we can accumulate is wealth. This have not sat well with the majority of the Singaporean as the wealth gap is getting bigger by the year and to accumulate more wealth means the government has to choose between the foreign corporate investing in Singapore or the its people. Many less privileges are being left behind by our fast moving society with no hope of catching up and in my humble opinion, our government have not done enough to help them. As a Singaporean myself i crave a true democracy but am also afraid true democracy may cause ourselves to self-destruct.",2018-11-30T14:40:51Z

Back then, Singapore did not want a lot of people moving into the country and become citizens. Lee knew there was not enough space to have mass migration and he did not want to grant you citizenship(good luck in trying to get a Singapore citizenship today).

But it’s unfair to compare Singapore (a city/state) to other Asian countries because  managing one small city is not as difficult as governing countries that have multiple cities, towns, distances, factions, etc.  I doubt the leaders of Singapore would be able to transform an entire country such as Indonesia, Philippines or China into one big Singapore.  Singapore is simply a small city with less political differences which makes it very successful.  It’s almost like comparing Harvard to that of many state schools within Massachusetts, Florida, Michigan or California which are bigger entities.  I’d like to see the leaders of Singapore transform North Korea.

xi6r3hZe5Tg,"Global warming means the sea level is going to rise and rise fast. Singapore, as a tiny island, is expected to be completely under water, if only sea level rises less than 15 feet from today.

We are not the best in manufacturing, not the best in higher education, not the best in human rights and many others. But I dare say we are one of the very few country that manage to score high in every key denominators that define one as successful. We do this often by pushing ahead unequally among the stakeholders leaving some behind. Cracks are already formed and one day we might turn insular like so many nations today have.
