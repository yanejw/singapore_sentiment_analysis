In other words, whenever you buy a new car, you're actually renting a car from the government for 10 years (By paying them a lumpsum rental charge of $115k). What's worse is, unlike a typical car rent, you also have to pay for car itself, its insurance,  road tax, petrol and maintenance etc. That is why Singapore is and will always be the most expensive country to own a car.",2023-03-11T17:00:06Z

MRT: while the MRT is coming every 2-3min during the day, it stops very frequently and stands still for almost a minute at each station, making commutes extremely long. Living just 2min from a MRT station, I am faster in the city center by jogging 5km than taking public transport. 
Busses: similar problem with busses. There are a lot of different bus lines doing almost the same routes and stopping at the same stations which leads to long queues, slowing everything down. 
Bike lanes: bike lanes go almost only through car-free areas (such as parks). Moreover, it is too dangerous to drive on the street as drivers do not watch out for cyclists. So, as of now, it is not really a feasible alternative for most people.
Cars: that point is actually very accurate. Streets are never too busy and there are almost no traffic jams due to the high costs of owning a car.
This comment obviously is based on a personal experience, but often it seems like Singapore has made a great job in imaging itself well to the outside world, while not fully living up to that image.",2022-10-31T13:47:21Z

I'll be the jerk who says the D-word, if no one else will: Singapore is essentially *a dictatorship.* That's what you call a state without opposition parties that stand a realistic chance of taking power from the reigning party. That's the secret as to why public works in Singapore are not shot down by NIMBY, the way they constantly are in other countries. We in the West tend to view government that operate this way as universally bad. Because during the early/mid 20'th century, we had some very, very times under such governments. And because many people living under such governments today, are still having a bad time of it. 
Please understand that I am by no means advocating for running things the way Singapore does, as there are serious risks involved, but: Singapore shows that a dictatorship need not be a totalitarian regime that rules against the will of it's people. As I understand it, people in Singapore could _theoretically_ just elect another party into power if they truly wanted to. The ruling party just enjoys enough support from the people, that that never actually happens. 
The elections in Singapore are more referenda than they are transfers of power; If the ruling party does something the people don't like or isn't taking things in the right direction ‚Äî The people vote for the opposition parties in greater numbers than normal, to let the ruling party know it screwed up somewhere.

People like choice and don't like being forced into things that they don't want.
I am sure that the idealists in this world are as thick as two short planks, that money could have been spent on improving the road structure and parking facilities  so that the cars could be on the road for less time thus reducing emissions and keeping peoples choice.",2022-09-25T11:29:54Z

vyfJgJBB3Vk,"The COE is under heavy criticism. It punishes car ownership, while a system according to car usage would be more according to economical and ecological principles. Also it favours wealthy people and bigger cars.
The public transport system is certainly good, but not as good as the stories everywhere told. For example, if it rains it can be difficult finding a transport. Also, the ""automatic"" monitoring, hmm, I think cost cuttings and maintenance problems sometimes cause break-downs, which can result in very bad effects, because it's a network in the end.
The HDB houses are anything than cheap nowadays. Of course, they are cheaper than the insanely priced private housing. But cheap, that was many years ago. To my personal opinion, a 99 year ""ownership"" is nothing else than a leasehold with upfront payment, not ownership.
The history of Singapore in terms of street culture and architecture is widely erased for the sake of everything being clean and well organized. But what is lacking is that certain atmosphere, that makes a country unique, and sometimes also a certain havoc factor.

Well, that all sounds as I am very negative, however, I think for a density populated place like this, Singapore government has done a great job overall, and keeps on doing good things, as also mentioned in the video.

On the other the country is doing very well for its citizens who are in a safe and competitive business environment. Things like freedom of speech, freedom of assembly etc. are literally restricted in Singapore. Also the People's Action Party (PAP) has been in power since 1959 which I think allows for more economic development while losing democratic attributes.

I guess what they say is true about economies, there is Developed, developing, Japan, and Singapore",2022-09-16T19:11:29Z

vyfJgJBB3Vk,Ive lived in two countries. Philippines and Singapore with the two of them being opposites in how theyve approached transportation. In the philippines citizens are encouraged to buy a car and multiple ones really and all it has done is screw up our traffic so bad while the public transportation is garbage. The routes of trains and buses are so limited and overcrowded that you basically have to fight your way in commuting everyday. Singapore much like Japan gives you the freedom of having the choice to not buy a car because public transportation is so good that you dont really need it.,2022-09-16T11:57:09Z

Only now in the last 10, 15 or so years they are building on better infrastructure to better serve satellite cities and ensure their growth so that not everyone who lives in Sydney has to work in Sydney proper. A new international airport along with a new metropolis is currently being built further out west about 40 km or so from the CBD, so this will also serve as a new major city within Sydney and all tied in with motorways, metro lines and railway with the existing satellite cities. It's something, unlike L.A which dont seem to have an plans on improving infrastructure. Personally i can't wait for Sydney to be modern and truly be a global city. The only major problem is high cost of living and being the most road tolled city in the world. I guess progress can't be free.",2022-09-15T23:58:30Z

vyfJgJBB3Vk,"Thank you for the video! Great work. I LOVE Singapore's metro system. I travel frequently to Singapore and use their metro system all the time. However, using LA as a comparison is terrible. Los Angeles's history was designed as a driving city. Car companies made the city the way it is because they wanted people to have cars, so mass transit development was shut out and so the city is BARELY trying to build their metro system is currently being built. Changing the driving culture of LA is going to be hard to do as well because the mass transit is not as connective throughout the entire city. I feel like Singapore's metro line is competitive to maybe the UK or Paris or even San Francisco.

You only see expensive cars (Porsche, Benz, Lamborghini, etc) or taxi cabs on the road. I was told it was because of the car taxes, prices, 10 year registration, etc.

Everyone lives in public housing, but they are really nice and have gardens on some levels, trees and flowers growing on the buildings. I was told the President's Wife spearheaded the effort to plant flowers on every building. It is a really, really, clean, beautiful city.

Freedom of speech may not seem important for many Singaporeans, but the truth is it is something that is inherent in us human beings. When all opposition voices are suppressed & wiped out, there is only 1 voice & that is the government's. There is simply no alternative voice for the locals to hear & make judgment. Whatever the authorities say becomes biblical truth. What ends up is a toxic, bounded Singaporean culture. Most of my friends have no time for other friends, except to either make more money to survive, or make more money to have more.  The cost of living here is high, plus the income inequality is high too.  Relationships become very transactional, country becomes a company where the people are subjects to the overlords. A beautiful picture is painted on the front, when it is not underneath. 

Talking about public transport, if you like to cram yourself with crowded spaces, then come here. The trains are always full due to overpopulation.  I have nothing else to say. Come & judge for yourself.",2022-09-15T14:54:42Z

People do not feel safe walking around anymore whether because they cant, due to the sidewalks being taken over by homeless camps, or because of the violent robberies happening in restaurants, on sidewalks, retail stores and the more popular ""follow home"" robberies which have become a common theme.  You can not travel on a train in LA or visit a train station without encountering several unhinged homeless folks or everyday common criminals up to no good.

Other than that, some rules such as the COE and high cost of living are just sacrifices we as Singaporeans accept, in exchange for efficient traffic flow, higher standards of living, higher minimum wages, etc. We love to complain about our life here, but honestly, its just because we have nothing else to complain about.",2022-09-14T15:18:33Z

vyfJgJBB3Vk,"I would like to add some perspective to the video. I can't tell you much about the housing, but the transport infrastructure definitely is not up to Dutch level. The MRT is amazing as you say, but biking in Singapore is just as horrible as it would be in the US: Very few dedicated bike lanes, no space on a sidewalk due to heavy foot traffic, 6 lane wide streets with very badly programmed traffic lights. I currently live in Singapore, but being used to Dutch cities, Singapore is significantly less walkable and bikeable. Yes, there are great underground malls and pedestrian bridges, but on the street level, cars get priority. In the Netherlands, 6 lane stroads get turned into tree-sided avenues with bike lanes and wide sidewalks, but that doesn't happen in SIngapore (yet). My main grip is with traffic lights: due to the wide roads, crossing takes super long, and you always have to wait multiple minutes because cars have to pass from many directions. In the Netherlands, pedestrians would get priority over cars even on large interchanges. At least they could make the traffic lights smart and change the cycle when someone presses the button to cross.

Except for this, amazing video",2022-09-14T14:56:59Z

vyfJgJBB3Vk,"Singapore is much more dense so the comparison to LA is inappropriate. Density really helps with public transport construction. That asides, the Singapore government also made a ton of mistakes building their infrastructure. They actually leaned into building a bus system during the inception of a public transport plan and utilise the road as much as possible (due to Harvard's advise, if I recall correctly). The result is, of course, huge amount of roads surface, even in the city centre, which is here even today. Only in recent decades did their rail transport system came onto their own with extensive network sprawling all over the island, something Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai, Seoul and many more cities, some were built long after Singapore became an economic powerhouse, have. 

Walking infrastructure in Singapore is still extremely expensive with tunnels and overhead bridges crossing huge roads that shouldn't have been necessary. Consider the amount of infrastructure Singapore have, their bike infrastructure is still subpar, average at best, which is a shame since the Netherland had done it, there's no reason a well run country and economy like Singapore couldn't emulate that, but alas most of the country is still connected through cars. 

This is not excusing LA's poor infrastructure of course. But they have different circumstances and should be studied separately. Notably, the U.S. draconian zoning laws and separation of community, refusal to have denser living and terrible town design are the root cause of poor public transport. To solve LA's problems, a decade long overhaul of everything in LA should be carried out, but such plans will always result in the ruling party losing the next election. There's no pressure to solve LA problems anyway. The rich and powerful, the only real power in government, is completely isolated from the plight of the common people. If homelessness and traffic jam affects rich people directly in their daily life, we will see a very policy direction. But, as it is, they just build their own shops in their own walled areas.",2022-09-14T11:48:04Z

vyfJgJBB3Vk,As a singaporean i personally enjoy the train system (MRT) in singapore. Its pretty quick and can take you almost everywhere you want to go. Its also pretty efficient and the train frequency is also not too bad :),2022-09-14T10:33:45Z

vyfJgJBB3Vk,"Love Singapore. I've been there 4 times, always have a good visit. Like here in Japan, public transportation actually WORKS! They also have tremendously large underground shopping areas (again like Japan) which can double as public shelters in bad weather or other dangerous conditions. The city where I live, Kobe, Japan, is also undertaking new projects to 'green' it and improve our city with more parks, walking-only streets leading through downtown areas, etc. for natural comfort and long-term livability. The designers may have based their ideas on Singapore's changes over the years...",2022-09-14T10:28:44Z

vyfJgJBB3Vk,"It seems like this channel always wants to find ways to talk about how bad the USA is. I like the channel and its content but it isn't fair to compare Singapore to LA. For one, the population density is different and this drives a lot of public transport initiatives. Another aspect is land area, while LA can build out, Singapore can't and this is reflected as such. 

Another area you mentioned is with the apartment buildings and how they were later demolished in the US. See, in Singapore there probably wasn't any difficulty getting the middle and lower classes to live in the apartments as there was likely no other alternative (and its much better then being homeless), however in the US there is other options as there is more land to build and buy houses with backyards and more privacy, so obviously apartment schemes in the US are vulnerable to ending up as low socioeconomic housing and will probably lead to them getting demolished. 

Probably the most important aspect however, is that in Singapore the government has pretty tight control on its people and seems to be able to actually do things, whereas in the US there are so many barriers to making actual progress. Look at the highspeed rail in California for example, it can't just be built, there are sooo many barriers and steps to overcome and funding and the political divide in the US is pretty much a nail in the coffin for a large project like this. 

Whereas in Singapore there seems to be little (if any) political divide - the current government holds 83 out of 103 seats in government. Also Singapore is one of the least corrupt countries in the world. So this actually allows Singapore to do things like what we see currently. Maybe if 80% of americans were on the same page there would be more cool projects like those seen in Singapore, but this doesn't seem likely. 

I say this as an Australian who is a fan of both countries   :)",2022-09-14T10:02:16Z

vyfJgJBB3Vk,The last part of the video shows a big con of democracy. Having opposing parties and quick turnover like the US just means that most proposals are just outright denied or cancelled once the next party takes over. This also leads politicians to just pander to voters without actually keeping promises just because they only want votes. How can you run a country well when every plan you make is opposed and you only have less than 4 or 8 years to do it.,2022-09-14T09:53:10Z

Most of the stations are purposefully designed to be ""honor system"" so nobody bothers to pay fares. I don't begrudge the people just looking for a sheltered place to sleep, but the trains and stations are crawling with people who are out to harass and bother others.

The US isn't designed for a public centered system, sure some larger cities have it on a higher level than others, but the US is designed for cars, whereas taxation on owning a car in Singapore is astronomical. You could spend a $135,000 on a car in Singapore, but that same car will be worth around $25,000 in other countries. That's because Singapore seeks to reduce the dependency on cars for its citizens.",2022-09-14T09:06:53Z
