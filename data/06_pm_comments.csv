Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Dictator?
If you call my government a dictator than your government is too
Example American government is a dictator especially Chinese government",2023-07-26T19:21:43Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"There is a difference between one country which has an authoritarian leader where people in power are rich and living in luxury but the people are poor and suffering AND a country where an ""authoritarian"" leader is democratically elected by the people in truly free elections and the people are served by excellent public housing programs, good healthcare services, a very efficient civil service, updated education at all levels, excellent public transport services, a comprehensive network of MRT train services and produces a world class airport which was voted Best Airport for 8 consecutive years by people outside of this nation led by an ""authoritarian"".  Elsewhere, if the leader is truly 100% democratic but many people are poor and hungry and jobless and homeless and in despair, then what the heck and so what if the leader is truly democratic.",2023-07-25T04:04:01Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"THE MOST corrupt and racist so-called first world country on the planet. Guilty until proven innocent, Lee dictatorship and a large amount of their 2.5 million citizens living in poverty...which is ironic as their ridiculous sovereign wealth fund STEALS 20% of their citizen's paycheck on a monthly basis. On current figures, if it was disbanded and given back, every single citizen (including right down to Babies) would receive $200,000 each...that's TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS per person.

Total scumbag regime...no identity, no rule of law.

And PolyMatter...the 'gamble' DID'NT pay off...unless you're a Lee or a Ching or a Wee or any other of the favoured few. Try asking the Singaporeans living in, essentially, council flats and worse in Jurong, Tampines... Little India.. I could go on.

Ask them if they'd like their $200k back.",2023-07-20T21:10:31Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"SG is often held up as some sort of example, but for my money a much better example is South Korea which has made equally impressive economic strides and gains, but is a proper country rather than a city-state, a democracy, an industrial powerhouse with brands known throughout the world, just as safe, clean and orderly and posseses an attractive popular culture. Don't get me wrong, I like SG and I have lived there, but I would put places like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan as more admirable places overall.",2023-07-16T15:47:12Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"The US needs to drop the term. The rest of the world understands the reasons behind the use of the term and is no longer supportive of the use of the term to justify America's hegemony. It is the same with the term ""Communist"" to reference China. America can keep its own mores and immorals to itself. But don't try pushing them on others that are ""clean"" and uncontaminated",2023-07-15T11:32:30Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"This production is inaccurate and biased, and portrays Singapore through the lense of a Western understanding of liberal democracy, which is extremely problematic because Singapore is not a western country and has a very different history.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,my fellow Singaporean back me up its definitely not as far as a dictatorship,2023-06-28T12:54:43Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Most if not all dictatorships in the world failed except Singapore.
The one key ingredient for successful governance is the elimination or mitigation of corruption.   Singapore is so successful because corruption in the government is ZERO tolerance.  THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE.
Your video seems to suggest political branch stacking and boundary manipulation to achieve this success.  Many western democratic countries use these same tactics and strategies.  They do not necessary lead to popularity and acceptance of their government or good governance.",2023-06-21T21:54:12Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Yes, they handled issues well only to make it corporation,, maybe it works ,, for example it’s the only country which doesn’t give issues to Tamils , making it an official language even, while having very less and less influential population ,, and the Srilanka and Indian homelands of Tamils give them nationalized pressure to get rid of their identity",2023-06-18T13:38:05Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"The reason is, we dont feel like we are under a dictatorship, and we feel free to complain, plus, the country takes care of financial unstable people but the catch is, the costs of living is very high, and the Goods and Services Taxes always increase",2023-06-18T05:41:18Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,Fake news,2023-06-11T10:18:45Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Singapore is not a dictatorship but a progressive democracy. what’s the point of changing leadership every 4 or more years and dismantling what good the previous government has done and start all over again. It’s a sheer waste national money and other resources. Most of the time, money is channeled into the pockets of corruptive government officials instead of sharing with the people. 

If the government is doing a fairly good job why need to change just for the sake of changing. That's so stupid. Just look at all the other countries. That’s not very smart. It’s just because that different groups of people want to have a taste of governing the country so that they can enjoy power and wealth. But they do nothing good or little for the country.
What’s the point? 

You can say whatever you want, but Singapore is enjoying being one of the most progressive nations in the world today. Many world leaders are admiring the success story of Singapore. Only small minded people would criticise and have only negative things to say about our nation. 

Yes, it is true that Singapore is not perfect. There are still some areas for improvement.  We just need to be patient and give feedback, that’s all. I welcome any opposition party that is honest and dignified. So far, I cannot see any. time and time again, they disappointed me with their lies, lack of character, and stupidity.",2023-06-10T23:54:12Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"What constitutes a dictatorship?
All societies require a higher level of decision making from the top than what is popularly believed, coming from the bottom majority.
It is a matter of what you prefer: a leadership and society that is transparent in how these actions are being manifested; or one that is fraught with deceit and lies to pull the veil over the majority in order for the elites to capitalise on the bottom majority?
Singapore is the former, how China and many others like them are now thriving, not just for the elites, but their respective societies.
Who are the latter? They are the ones who are now sliding down the social evolution ladder, especially now they are unable to capitalise from without, so have to cannibalise from within.
The social structures and cognitive realisation in the world today are seeing out the winter of deceit and the spring of truth and honesty. Those who are still unable to let go of the old ways of deceit and dishonest gains, are going to either go extinct by necessity or die trying to hold on to their old ways.",2023-06-06T00:50:44Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"As a Singaporean, majority of young adults here are well-aware of how authoritarian Singapore is. We openly call PAP a dictatorship or openly-corrupt. Ministers gets payed millions, laws are solely made by one party, and anything we disagree with will still be implemented. 

But the trade-off? High pay, amazing healthcare, world class public transportation, amazing amenities. Personally, I did average in school yet I have no worries for the future living in Sg even more so for those with higher education. Its practically a utopia for middle class families and heaven for the rich. It still has lower income families of course, but they are heavily supported to have the bare minimum which is housing. I love and hate PAP, but I can’t deny the convenience of living here. All that’s said, I will most likely NOT retire here, but I am sure to be able to move to any country with my decent education from this country and powerful passport at the end of the day.

What I think is important is really accountability, I don’t care if PAP ran the government but I want an opposition capable of at least keeping them in check and the public aware. Which has sadly yet to happen.",2023-04-27T09:05:46Z

If Western democracies led to the believen WMD and wrongfully attack Iraq and invented ISIS that the whole world has to deal with ISIS' export of extremist terrorism, then they ought to be ashamed of themselves. 

If neary 3,000 were lives lost in 911 that led to a multi decade war in Iraq and Afghanistan that resulted in an embarrassing withdrawal and leaving the country in a worst mess than before Taliban control and costing trillions of dollars and lost of 4,500 US soldiers' lives and another 500,000 civilian lives lost in Iraq and Afghanistan, why US just cannot put in the same resolve and resources to deal with its own gun laws that cost 10,000 lives every year? Just deal with your own gun laws that deprive your own people freedom to live & WORST costing 10,000 lives lost to gun violence every year before you even talk about freedom of Taiwan. It is a big joke that Pelosis cannot even secure freedom in her own home and yet have the gumption to fight for Taiwan's freedom and created so much tension that the world do not need. 

Western countries need to take a hard look at themselves and tidy up their own backyards before even teaching other asian countries that their way of governing their backyards are not up to Western's standards!

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"It's interesting how many people are experts on democracy when there are exactly two countries in the world with true (=direct) democracies: Switzerland and Liechtenstein (although in Liechtenstein, a ruler is also involved).

I am Swiss and live in Switzerland.

The direct democracy ensures that the tax burden never gets too high and that important issues can be voted upon by the parliament or even initiated by ordinary people to be voted on by the entire country.
It also ensures that important issues are not resolved fairly since a majority is interested in keeping it the way it is and incentivized to prioritize their needs above other peoples or future generations. This can be seen in our retirement system which no politican has the balls to tackle since they know that mostly old people vote and mostly old people benefit from the artificially high rents (which are paid for by younger people).

Also, as a friend used to say: The average person is quite dumb and 50% are even dumber. Not politically correct but true.
A uninformed persons vote for any topic you can vote on (not just electing politicians) carries the same weight as an informed persons vote. Or even the same weight as the vote of a person who is a globally renowned expert on said topic/issue. So a party/politician who knows how to persuade the masses - with or without merit to their position - can garner a low of votes. This can be very dangerous.

To think that democracy = good and dictatorship = bad is a ideology that is plaguing a lot of people.
People who don't even live in genuine democracies.

A benevolent dicatorship who focuses on the prosperity of their country and citizens by running things smoothly, efficiently and effectively can be better for a country than democracy (in terms of education, healthcare, prosperity, retirement systems, taxes, etc.).

There are signs and cameras everywhere warning and discouraging from stealing or even just to show you the signs of stroke or child neglect with an injunction to call the police. I even saw a sign that said it was illegal to stare at people's bodies at the beach. Probably the worst thing I learned was that the government has a large amount of control over how you receive your retirement money. 

That being said, as an American I am always cautious of possible power abuse, not just it's manifestation. I kind of just see Singapore as lucky. I do think Singapore can maintain itself and become more democratic at the same time, it just requires something that the US lacks as well, and that is education and inculcation to vote as a politically educated and humble individual who is willing to make sacrifices. What I mean is that yes, we ought to teach our populace about economics, psychology, philosophy, etc. but we also need to somehow teach epistemic humility. Just because you took some economics courses it  does NOT mean you are an expert. We need to vote by track record, skill set, and trustworthiness NOT by what our inferior opinion on tax policy, interest rates, public spending, or healthcare are.

3. The government delivers - its service to the public is some of the best in the world. Very few Western European or North American countries can match its efficiency. Again, there is no preferential treatment. Being rich or famous will not help you cut lines.

4. No unions, but extremely strong social security, so, if terminated, you will get unemployment benefits to go by. Obviously, the government will breath down your neck and force you to accept a lower paying less relevant job to get you out of dole. However, if you are sick, social security kicks in and pays for your periods of illness.

5. No collective burgain, but competitive wages because the whole society is geared towards meritocracy. That also causes hidden pockets of poverty among low-skilled immigrant workers that Singapore successfully hides.

6. Very strong rule of law - corollary to no. 2. A politician cannot take advantage of the people with impunity. No Uday Saddam picking up women that he fancied from universities and then unceremoniously dumped at her family's door step.

7. One of the greatest public transport system in the world and is geared in such a way that even senior corporate leaders take public transport.

These cause people or sheeple to live a content life. In any democracy, it is usually a very small minority that questions the status quo and drives changes. Democracies tolerate them because they work as a safety valve and also sometimes come up with brilliant ideas that governments can implement and take the wind out of these radical movements. Think of the social security and universal healthcare introduced all over the Europe to defend social democracy against communism. 

In Singapore, that minority is not tolerated. The rest 98% simply do not care and are happy to live better than first world life style with decent pay packages.",2022-10-01T19:33:16Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"As a Singaporean, this video is only partially true with regards to the criticisms. Much of the examples quoted were exaggerated and not given the correct context. Being one of the most highly educated country population in the world, majority of us are keenly aware of what works for our country, why they work and which proposed policies actually are likely to work. The proof of the pudding is in the tasting. Why was there such huge success within one generation? Because we tend to choose intelligent leaders who have enough experience to possess foresight and let them can get the job done unhindered. This is preferred to having democracies that implode because voters may not be educated enough to make good choices and are instead driven by emotions from 'airware' campaigns. Just because the more capable leaders were already captured by the PAP doesn't mean we try to spite them and sabotage ourselves by voting for less capable people elsewhere. The cause and effect is wrong in the video and neither understands the true situation on the ground nor reflect the views of the majority of Singaporeans. Personally, I'll choose effective government over one mired in time wasting debates in parliament and achieving no real outcomes. Just need to take a good look at the USA to contrast. A large proportion of voters that can be easily manipulated by disinformation campaigns in the name of freedom of speech, leading to a good chance of them democratically electing incapable/weak leaders. Absolutely inefficient, no wonder domestically things are still so backward. Absolutely not looking forward to 2024 where Donald Trump gets reelected by the majority again.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Interesting discussion, very much an example of what I've always said: the advantage of dictatorship is the fact that it can get shit *done.*  The disadvantage of dictatorship is that it can get *shitty things* done.  

The choice hinges entirely on the choices of one ruler and the favour of a small handful of power brokers who help maintain that rule.  (In typical dictatorships, these are groups like the military leadership because the maintenance of power is done through violent suppression of the public or threats of same; in old medieval European kingdoms, these would be the king's direct vassals and the Catholic Church; in Singapore, I don't know who these people would be, but I'm sure the Prime Minister knows exactly who they are.)  

Generally, the biggest problem with dictatorships where the leader's choices are good for their country at large is succession: It's very common for dictatorship to be inherited, passed down from father to son.  This works fine when the son is raised to have a solid understanding of their role and generally wants to be a responsible leader, but wait long enough and you inevitably have a son who'd rather just enjoy the luxury of ultimate power or you lose a dictator early before their successor can be properly trained, and they make terrible mistakes that disrupt the very fine balance of a prosperous dictatorship and in their attempts to stabilize things, almost always manage to destroy everything that made their realm special.  Or you just have some jackass who wants personal power assassinate the dictator and his family and declare himself ruler, which kicks off a civil war that runs the country into the ground (see the Roman Empire, repeatedly).  

Singapore's veneer of democracy might actually serve another purpose: distributing power just enough that leaders can be cultivated and selected based on their ability to meet the standards of the party as a whole.  If you're selecting leaders based on how well they fill the shoes of the previous leader, rather than through arbitrary means like primogeniture, the odds of winding up with a leader who isn't suited to the task are greatly reduced.  Or it might be just as unstable as every other dictatorship, just waiting for the right (wrong) leader to bring it all crashing down.",2022-06-23T20:14:00Z

There’s something to be said for a benevolent dictator, the problem is they’ll eventually die and you may end up with a tyrant. Constitutional monarchy I think is the way to go. With a tyrannical democracy the people may be lulled into complacency if they think the leader has legitimacy other than that of defending their rights and furthering their collective prosperity.",2022-06-22T22:43:29Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"This is a country who obviously is trying to overcome one of the glaring and destructive flaws in democracies. The only way that a truly democratic structure could be the best for providing a good government (and leaders) is if the candidates were all highly educated, intelligent, well informed, of good character, and honest. There is simply no way the average voter can be a judge of every candidate. And, in many cases, the results of the primaries to pick the party candidates is more of a popularity contest, or the ad agencies clever work to convince the gullible public (as in America). The truth is that most of the voters in a democracy are not able to even begin to understand if a candidate is qualified or capable to assume the position of president and successfully lead the nation.
If a country has an uneducated and/or a misinformed populace, the results of an honest election can be disastrous. Since no one has come up with a way to screen the eligibility of their citizens to vote based on their capability, democratic elections are a true crap shoot. 😏",2022-06-17T15:49:42Z

Every dictator with at least two brain cells already realized that traditional dictatorship doesn't work very good (or you end up like North Korea)... so, they just cheaply deceived their own people by showing them only what they want to see while doing everything to preserve this vail to hide their true intentions... money and power... literally like a company... you exploit your people while giving them a little bit something extra so they feel grateful and let you exploit them even more... endless cycle until suddenly everything falls apart...

Somehow Afghanistan national reserve instead of going to ppl who are starving is going towards 911 victims and US is confiscating the other portion classic abuse of power. Freedom and rights are just manipulation, like a band aid in front of brutal politic, Snowden demonstrated freedom and look where it got him, so much for freedom lol.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Okay so I'm a Singaporean and in general though many of the new generation considers the government as a dictatorship/mornachy, it really isn't. It is very much a democracy where the ruling party gains near absolute power for a term. 
Here's some of the problems with that though, people are less seen as people and part of a machine, there is a constant rat race in singapore that's indoctrinated into you from childhood to adulthood, better grades, better scores means you're a better person. 
The way the government is structured isn't bad per say but it makes it very very hard for change to occur. 
Singapore is probably one of the safest places in the world where free press and classrooms might be actively controlled by the government but you are given the free choice to seek out different forms of media and idealogies. 
Here's the thing though, if you are given 2 pizzas everyday, one made of low quality cheese but is free and the other which a better quality but cost dollar, eventually, you will choose the low quality at least once every other day then if you're given this choice everyday and told by the books you learn from about how great the free pizza is, this would increase your chances of choosing it. This is how the government here gives you the choice. Heck sometimes you don't even know the choice for paid pizza is even a choice, this is how the government here trains kids to support them.
A majority of the younger generation are trying to move away from this idea of the rat race or are trying to help change the old laws of Singapore especially regarding LGBTQIA+ but against a system that can change but is prone not though it is difficult, Singapore is far from a dictatorship, it is very much a democracy.",2022-06-11T09:20:11Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Saying ""the inly thing getting in the..."" is a far fetched and arguably inappropriate reduction of national politics/economics. Singapore allowed itself to be a work center for the West and excluded the rest of Malaysia in doing so. There are plenty of international coties around the world that have had similar positions. Shanghai, Lagos, etc... Singapore is located in the center of the global export hub that is East Asia and thus is a prime location for businesses to set up headquarters/outposts. Singapore has benefitted from relative regional stability. It is small and thus has a lower GDP/cap:HDI ratio than most nations (it's far cheaper/more profitable to build public transit in a city-state than to do so through a rural country). Asian nations (the confucian point) are far less revolutionary in character than Western or African nations, with respect for authority deeply ingrained in their cultures, meaning a dictatorship doesn't have to spend as many resources oppressing their populace and putting down rebellions as they would have to in another country. Singapore was lucky that it's dictators wanted to build a powerful nation instead of being like Sri Lanka and intentionally destroying their country. 

Politics isn't an obstacle to progress. It's a method of doing things, progressive and counter-productibe things. It certainly slows everything down if consensus isn't reached, but there are ways around this/ways of running a country so that people don't want to throw out the government everytime there's an issue. Some of those things are vaguely fascistic - silencing the media, charging those who levy false allegations or incendniary accusations against the regime, purging corrupt officials, but fundamentally, it involves three things. 
1). As you mentioned, is ensuring that you deliver for the population. 
2). Is preventing malignant forces from gaining a foothold in your country to begin with. (Mafias, disloyal businesses, etc...)
3). Is helping your populace to understand the government's role in crises resolutions before they happen. ""Yes, there is a bad drought and food prices have increased. We are working on reallocating funds from research into etc... to help pay for hunger relief programs. We expect to lower food prices at the point of purchase by 7% by this November. We are in this together."" 
And you force any station that calls themselves news to air that statement whenever they address the issue of inflation in food prices. If a channel does not, or they make incendiary comments claiming that the government is ignoring the food crisis and not doing enough to relieve inflation but they do not back this up with hard evidence that there are solutions that government officials are choosing not to pursue, you fine them, you refuse them interviews, you force them to remove ""News,"" from their name, because they are exploiting a crisis for personal gain. That's not politics. That's business. 

A good example of the problem is the US, where school shootings are played all over television and Democrats take the opportunity to proclaim that they can solve that problem and then discuss gun control policies that would not do much to change the number of gun deaths in the country. Republicans and Democrats taking different positions on gun control isn't a problem. Republicans and Democrats discussing policies openly and backing them up with data isn't a problem. The problem is that Democrats have a large mafia backing and the illegal firearms market will benefit them and Republicans get funding from legal gun manufacturers, the NRA and the like, so preventing gun control benefits them, thus there is no intended solution being discussed, only corruption without accountability.",2022-06-08T19:30:33Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"For everyone saying that Singapore has no resources: Singapore's ""resource"" is being in such a strategic point for world trade. It's easier for countries to trade with each other there, instead of sailing all the way from China to Europe or vice versa. Before Singapore, there was another rich trading city in the straits called Melaka.


But Trade is a different ""resource"" to oil or minerals  - in the latter, your country only needs unskilled, poor citizens to work the mines. For Trade, you need a stable business environment and educated workers at any cost. That's why Singapore keeps its population rich enough to not disturb the business.

It's still a great place to live, but it's not like every country can get this wealthy with the same policies, Rwanda already tried that.",2022-05-25T04:15:27Z

Killing, hurting, and silencing it’s people. If it was really as good as it claims it wouldn’t have to do that. Government is transactional. If you give the people what they want, they give you their vote.

China went from an extremely poor, agrarian state before the communists won the civil war, then a slow but steady rise at the beginning of Mao's reign, followed by the catastrophic failure to modernise the country coinciding with one of the worst famines in modern history that comprised the Great Leap Forward, before the Chairman's initial deposal, and another slow but steady rise, intersected by the Cultural Revolution and the replacement the previous leader with Chairman Mao once more, marked by the destruction of historical texts, this time damaging the rich cultural background of China, while the economy stagnated, before Mao's death and replacement preceded exponential growth, along with the one-child policy, which decreased the ridiculous strain on the country caused by the massive and rapidly growing population of China, and finally, president Xi Jinping was put into power, accelerating China's growth into its position today of the secondary world superpower.",2022-04-10T03:10:57Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"The World’s Moral And Practical Obligation To Ukraine

In Ukraine, there is both a moral and practical obligation, which transcends the fact of there being no formal obligation from NATO or the EU.
As we know from history, formal obligations crumble in the face of reality when dealing with someone like Putin. I am not complaining so much as I am cautioning the entire world that if it is not willing to nip in the bud the actions of Putin now, we will most certainly be compelled to confront him later. And the effects of that will probably be much worse than the risk of starting a third world war now.
A world that bows to the will of a bully and dictator today, will either become a virtual pawn of that bully and dictator or be forced to fight him later. As we saw with Hitler, because the world was not willing to confront him early on, the ultimate conflagration that resulted was much worse than it might otherwise have been.
Just as a free individual cannot long endure the abuse and domination of a bullying neighbor, so too, the free nations of the world cannot long endure the abuse and dominance of a bully and dictator among them.
Of course, the possibility of nuclear war is paralyzing, and the present fear of that happening is what gives Putin his ultimate edge. He knows this and wants the world to think he might be crazy enough to use nuclear weapons. We need to call his bluff by letting him know that we will even risk nuclear war to save freedom and democracy in the world.
The world not only allowed Putin to exist but did business with him. Now humanity must pay the karmic price for its complicity. And that price may be a third world war, which might even mean nuclear war.
This is a horrifying thought, but reality does not care what is horrifying to humanity. The world we create and the results of that creation are as they are. If we cater to autocrats, we will have to live with autocracy as the way of the world - or we can stop allowing autocrats to evolve and exist in the world.
At the moment, Ukraine is the center of our universe. It is the focal point and pivot point for our future. What we decide to do there will determine the direction we will take to that future and what that future will be. Will it be a world where freedom and democracy become the way of the world for all humankind, or will it be a world where the dream of freedom and democracy is dead, and slavery and autocracy rule?

Not only did they help us financially, they also put in place a system where anyone can strive to be successful if they have the right mindset.

I think compared to others of my age, I am grateful for what the government has done to help us in our time of needs.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"This reminds me of my country's recent history (Barbados), though it is a slightly different case. In both of the last two elections, the last being just last month, the current ruling party (BLP) won all the seats, that being twice in a row. It should also be noted that the last election was announced like 2 weeks notice as well, similar to what was mentioned in the video, so there was a good bit of contention there. Nevertheless, as it stands, there's really no political opposition to the BLP, something that has ruffled a good few feathers here and abroad in terms of concerns for democracy, and it really has me thinking long and hard about the whole thing in general. 

The historical competitor to the BLP (DLP) is pretty much all but finished at this point after their two term run that ended in 2018, complete with sewage-filled streets and beaches (actual literal sewage, it made international news), corruption scandals and a most obvious attempt at scorched-earth tactics once they figured the boat was sinking. On the other hand, Barbados has seen serious economic and infrastructural growth under the BLP and has become a notable player on the international stage. There _were_ a number of new parties popped up back then, which at the time seemed to show some promise, but they all really lacked a lot needed to fill the DLPs shoes and go up against the BLP. In some ways, Barbados has become a bit of a one-party state, but Barbadians gladly choose BLP because we know that things will get done, and in a weird way it's democracy, like this is how democracy _should_ work, but also, it's not?.. It's quite the dilemma tbh.",2022-02-06T14:19:38Z

Bringing down a rotten leader is the highest civic act I can think of, epitomized by St. George killing the Dragon. What if the Dragon is good--a possibility that the Chinese mind favours, b.t.w.? I see this as the wrong question, to be reworded as, ""Has enough been done to expose its misdeeds?"" The fundamental principle that power corrupts is so deeply engrained in my western political sensibility that the handful of notable exceptions merely reinforce it (through their very scarcity). It all boils down to trust, I guess, and the fact that Singapore is a very young state plays in its favour: sixty years is, for a political entity, little more than a honeymoon between ruler and ruled.

(in my class I was getting blamed for many things people in power did to a few years back and I'm still a minor so imagine that, even some trusted adults were against me due to being misled by said person in power, leading me to start doubting everything. it's so bad that even now my parents still somewhat believe that it's completely my fault for such a case even when I've done most of what I could as a student)
there are awards that over 50% of the students in the nation qualify for, but less than 10% are actually nominated let alone win, there are also many grants giving the illusion of a very free giving government but are often so difficult to find, you can go to a random adult on the street and they might not even know some grants exist, it's there, but it's hidden

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"This is an interesting analysis but as a Singaporean, I have to say that there is quite a lot of Singapore's history that was not properly analyzed especially when there was a lot of focus on the PAP remaining in power. The choice to take this ""authoritarian shortcut"" was something borne out of necessity and not just a high risk high reward decision. During the period of decolonization, Singapore as an independent state was at its weakest and most vulnerable. My parents tell me of stories when gangs roamed the streets, how there were always fights breaking out that our ""ang chia"" (anti-riot vehicles) had to come and stop, how several families were crowded under one roof and shared one toilet, and all the stuff that you could never imagine when you look at modern-day Singapore. Authoritarianism is a system with its flaws, but in a time of civil unrest with a divided population, ruling with an iron fist and setting the country onto one specific path was the most socio-politically viable way for Singapore to survive and move forward in a short period of time. We were just lucky that our ruling party was not so greedy and corrupt to begin with, so under their leadership, Singapore went from third to first world in a single generation. This is not to say our governance is perfect, in fact, it is far from it. A lot of the early policies heavily affected the people of the previous generations. My grandparents and parents were hit by these rapid changes and struggled to adapt. But the choices the government made in those early days were what made Singapore the country it is today. Singapore is certainly not a perfect utopia, there exists no such thing in the world. But as a Singaporean, I personally believe it is as close to a utopia as it gets. I would rather have peace and security over democracy and freedom. If anyone would like to understand more about Singapore's decision and position to rule as a ""hybrid democracy"", I implore you to watch Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam's speech at the 45th St Gallen Symposium.

This is the key. The overshot of democracy will bring us to chaos. I am not defending singapore government, but as resident, I feel the current government has thought how to maintain the citizen interests. They have been trying so hard. Because they realize this is the key to maintain singapore as one unity nation. With 3 big ethnic groups, Singapore has also a potential of civil conflict. Therefore, the government need to take care all sectors then the citizen could live peacefully
In the other hand, the oppositions, they did not offer any solutions or good program for citizen. They just insulted and try to critize the government without any better solutions. In fact, most of Singaporean are relatively the highly educated person. Thus, they could see and analyse whose the best party who could perform the best solution. 
If the oppositions want to overcome the current incombent, they need to do their homework to offer the better and more realistic solution for citizen. Otherwise, they will not win the election. This is my opinion. Thank you",2022-01-08T00:24:56Z

America is not a democracy. Never has been. Remember the pledge of allegiance. AND TO THE REPUBLIC, FOR WHICH IT STANDS. America exports democracy to keep rivals down.

Democracy is to say 51% of the population can tell 49% of the population what they should do in a two way issue. With fewer and fewer people dictating unilaterally what everyone else must do the more ways something splits. You got a 5 way split on an issue? You can have 21% of the population ruling over 79% of the population. Democracy is objectively awful. It has no filtering process to ensure those choices are leaned towards the better outcomes and it has no balancing of power to ensure smaller groups, or worse, split majorities get any representation.

Speaking of the idea of dictatorship in Singapore's government, it is very hard to say that it is because Singapore's modus operandi is  the form of a parliamentary representative democratic republic. This way not everyone has the power and not anyone can abuse their position.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"The biggest compliment to Singapore system was Deng Xiaoping followed Singapore's model to shape modern China. A country with 4000 years of history, willing to learn from what's essentially a city state built by their migrants.  

One of the strange system that I feel iffy about, but seems to be doing well, is the public fund for private gains. This sounds like a nightmare, but their system created incentive for ruling politicians to keep their economy churning. One of the problem with classic dictatorship is corruption. To reduce corruption, they provided incentive by allowing a stake in their sovereign wealth fund, the Temasek Holdings, which is owned by the government of Singapore. Their reward structure incentivise politicians to keep the economy rolling, stability and productivity, which in turn directly enriched them in the long run. This tries to alleviate the familiar scenario of populist ceasing power, hogging all the public wealth to themselves, consolidate power with purges then their descendants escape the country when they fail. We have seen both left and right cessation of power around the world, which established a corrupted government only interested in enriching themselves quick before the consequence arrive. That being said, Singapore is still facing huge wealth inequality, lack of innovation as their most innovative workforce would quickly leave for the U.S. instead and of course, mounting discontent from long rule of a single party. For now, the regime and the country is still stable, but I question if Singapore can take a hit from the next recession that might very well originated from their origin, China. When 2008 hits, Singapore suffered the consequences, but thanks to China's rapid rise, it managed to shift its investment to that area instead. Hoping its South East Asia investments to be less affected by a fallout from any instability from China would be optimistic. Unlike a crisis originates from the U.S., which controls the finance of the world at the time, a crisis in China will severely affect everyone from manufacturing, shipping, consumption, finance to even food shortage and very probable, war over vital resources like rare earth, fossil fuel and water due to China controlling and consuming most natural resources on earth. Singapore now has an interest in keeping the Chinese regime from landing on the ground hard, but what can a small island nation do?

You want to know why nobody complain in Singapore? Because this nation under the guidance of the PAP went from a 3rd world country in 1965 (years of independence from Malaysia)  to a top Earning per Capita in the world, higher than Germany and with 90 of house ownership and practically no unemployment. Nobody here is afraid of being out late at night, even young girls, there are no school shooting because weapons are forbidden under penalty of law. You brag a lot about freedom but in USA people have to queue hours, without food and drink to exercise the right to vote (by your new laws), here I voted in that election and it took me the best part of 10 min even with COVID procedure in place after I got an allotted time window in a polling station 5 min walk from home. Americans call freedom being forced to pee in bottles, take a dump in plastic bottles , having their tips stolen by their employees, working 2 or 3 jobs, having to choose between food or medications, paying the most expansive medical services in the world, having Uni students buried under debts. Here in Singapore we call freedom, being able to send your children to one of the best education systems in the world, having state sponsored scholarships for the brightest, having access to: affordable housing, one of the fastest Internet cable service in the world, the best Airline and Airport in the world.

It's capitalistic in nature, but left leaning in every other policy. 
Singapore is just the USA, if there were only Democrats running the country. The only difference between the US and Singapore is that Singapore is a 1 party system, and the US is a 2 party system. 
As a leftist, I can point to Singapore as a place that proves Public Healthcare, higher wages, and more funding for education are just policies limited by government and not economics. But I can also point to the blatant lack of freedom of press in tbe country. It reminds me a lot of ""communist"" dictators. Mao, Stalin, Castro were all dictators who had great policy ideas, but never gave up power. 
Through the lens of capitalism, Singapore is the ideal model for competition making everything better. It really is the Democrats ideal country. One where the ultra wealthy can still hoard the wealth and power, but the average person is doing well. 
This video made a great point about Imperialism at the start. Singapore is small, it does lack resources, and in the grand scheme of the world, its unimportant. But that saved the Island from being raped by Europe, specifically England. While it didn't get a head start on other nations ravaged by Imperialism, it was also never given a handicap like many asian and african countries. 
I am strongly anti Fascist in every way. It's hard to look at Singapore and not criticize its leadership. I feel the same way about the US and its 2 party system. ""1 party has ran Singapore for 50 years"" well 2 parties with Similar goals, views, and leaders have been running the US for 250 years. It's often stated that ""america is a company"" and this is true. I guess Singapore is a country with a CEO who holds most of the stocks where as the US is a publicly traded mega corporation who is run by share holders. The share holders being the .1% and the 2 major parties",2022-01-04T05:25:04Z

and like you said most of the people there are already content with what they have in terms of politics... and their mentality is always the same.... which is that PAP will win anyways so why do i have spend time to vote for them... or they voted some random opposition out of spite... its opposition is probably filled with some PAP's own funded people that does those stupid things to make the opposition look bad when they campaign against PAP for all we know.... but the public perception of them is kinda bad choice in general anyways... so it doesn't matter much at all... except that trending line...

not saying this system is bad... don't get me wrong.... PAP is actually a wonderful party and is good at its job in managing singapore as a corporation, but i am just saying the opposition also leads a huge part in never getting elected even if we look past these things that the PAP did against them... as what the PAP did against them is only for the sake increasing that trending line value and making it an upward trend if possible...

you should live in singapore and experience a few of the voting periods, because half the time you can actually see how easy it is for the PAP to smear their competitors in all media outlet because of how the opposition wants to run singapore... its not as hard as you make it sounds like....",2022-01-04T05:00:51Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"The fascinating thing about Singapore is that is an ""efficient dictatorship"" which in itself is a contradictory term since normally authoritarian regimes devolve in a way were the government allows corruption from it's high ranking officials (and army generals) in exchange for their support to the regime. 
It will be really interesting to see what happens the day when the PAP loses the majority of the vote even with this rigged system, something that will happen sooner or later because history in places like Venezuela, Russia or Zimbabwe has shown that ""authoritarian competitive"" is not a system but a transitional stage before outright dictatorship. 
However, these countries are completely different in their level of development and idiosyncrasies because their system devolved into massive corruption and poorer citizens (read first paragraph) and I suspect Singapore will never be like this. But the way this video explains how now the Singaporean government is giving ""priority"" to their voters/supporters for housing and other rights over suspected opposition voters sounds like a first step to use the state treasury to favor the PAP voters/supporters and this could mean prioritizing a less productive yet loyal PAP voters over a more productive (tax paying) pro-opposition citizen.
Later on, this might lead to accept more corruption from high ranking officials as long as they keep their support to the regime and this is how dictatorship normally work and why they are by nature inefficient and corrupt.
But, as far as for me now, I don't see the Singaporean system with bad eyes, it's truly fascinating and I'll be keeping an eye on how this political experiment evolves.",2022-01-03T19:35:21Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"First question: What do you say to a beggar who tries to teach you how to become a millionaire?

One cannot sell what he doesn't have.

Governing a country is not only in form or ideals. It must also be in results.
In other words, Democracy if a load of rubbish if it cannot produce results its people need.

It is time we re-evaluate Democracy. 

What good is democracy when the actual government is not the White House, no the Congress, non the Senate but WALL STREET?
What good is democracy when you have a government of the rich, by the rich and for the rich?
What good is democracy when you have hundreds of thousand destitute homeless people?
What good is democracy when you have hundreds of thousand jobless people?
What good is democracy when you have hundreds of thousand do not have access to quality healthcare?
What good is democracy when you have 2 terms of presidentship which cannot lay out 15 years, 20 years, 25 years plans for the country?

And the list goes on.

Now:

What is so bad about a NON-liberal democracy when 100% of its population or everybody has a roof over his head?
What is so bad about a NON-liberal democracy when 100% of its population or everybody has access to quality healthcare?
What is so bad about a NON-liberal democracy when 100% of its population or everybody has access to quality education?
What is so bad about a NON-liberal democracy when 100% of its population or everybody can get a job if he is willing?

What is so bad about a NON-liberal democracy when its government is recognized internationally as the top 7 least corrupted country in the world?
What is so bad about a NON-liberal democracy when its government delivers tangible results consistently over the last 50 years?

And the list goes on.

It is time to re-evaluate Democracy. Just look at China which is a not a Democracy. Democracy is not the be-all and end-all for progress.

While I feel pity for those he has jailed, he did so knowing he could bring singapore up unhindered.

I live in Ireland and I'm moving to Spain because the cost of rent has been shooting up for 6 years in a row now with very little change in minimum wage. Couple that with the fact that you stay on minimum wage for much longer here than in other countries, as well as the quality of housing and the price of everything else means that your average person is living in conditions that people in many continental European countries would find disgraceful. I'm paying 650 euro a month to live in a city of only 200k people on 10 euro an hour despite starting work when I was FIFTEEN. I have plenty of experience and yet this keeps happening. In Spain (and many other countries) the wage compared to rent is much better. I stayed there for a few months and couldn't get over how much better the quality of life was even though they (rightfully) complain about the cost of living. In Ireland you will almost always pay half your wages for rent at the very least (and good luck getting regular hours). If you go looking online, a shitty hovel in Cork is about 700 euro now. I moved to Cork 2.5 years ago and it was roughly 550 then. In Dublin you get charged 1200 euro to share a mattress with a stranger. I'm not exaggerating.",2021-12-08T10:15:30Z

They'll nag and complain, but someone will do something about it instead of waiting for someone to do it for them, like the government.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Somewhat unnuanced;
""At stake, however, was not really the ruling party, its policies, or even the general direction of the nation.""
Majority of Singaporeans are not interested in politics, period. Implicit in this statistical observation is that they are satisfied with the government, or else they would be interested in influencing change in government policies. HENCE, it makes much less sense for policies or the general direction of the nation to matter in the election. The pervasive feeling that analogous processes are implied to face the same circumstances as those in Western democracies (and that their presence should effect to similar results, even) really does not do justice in conveying the local nuance of government and politics in Singapore. 

The constraints of other modern nations make democracies and DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES intuitive - even rational - but these stabilising political processes should not be abstracted away from its context to embody it with some inherent, acontextual virtue. As was emphasised in the video, Singapore's development would have be impossible to instate in conjunction with conventional democratic systems. In that respect, within the BRIEF history of Singapore politics, much of the democratic freedoms currently espoused in Western countries are historically CONTRARY to the values which have led to prosperity within Singapore.

To ignore this context and reduce Singapore to just another authoritarian regime BUT WITH an anomalously successful economy does not make sense;
and while I admit that much of this video is merely informative, hence that my issue is with the minor effect, the implication that Singapore is just some miracle authoritarian regime on some invisible precipice of political collapse is just WRONG, or at least, unreasonable.",2021-12-04T11:27:24Z

Most Singaporeans like me do want the PAP to continue governing Singapore. We believe they have been doing a good job so far.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Really, the US government isn't all that different. It's just that we've been fooled into thinking the divide in our government is between Democrats and Republicans, when in fact the true divide exists between Establishment and Populist. Our government currently belongs almost entirely to the Establishment, and there's a reason for that. Populists rarely, if ever, stand a chance in elections because Establishment candidates typically receive millions of dollars' worth of campaign contributions from billionaire elites who benefit from Establishment rule, allowing them to all but shut out their Populist opponents who have to rely on traditional donations from their supporters. The only time Democrat vs. Republican ever truly comes into play is when both mainstream candidates in a general election are pro-Establishment; otherwise, it tends to be an absolute bloodbath in the Establishment's favor.

Donald Trump's run for the Oval Office exposed the flaws in this system. He had the devastating one-two punch of already being an established media figurehead, and having access to a massive pool of funds at the start of the race. These two factors allowed him to counteract the billionaire donor deluge for pro-Establishment Clinton in a way that, prior to the 2016 Presidential election, was unheard of. This ability to get his Populist message out unhindered enabled him to gain a massive following whose donations were then able to carry his campaign across the finish line in an almost unprecedented upset.

This is precisely why the 2020 election should terrify each and every one of us. After four years of the Establishment, alongside its billionaire elite cohorts, fighting tooth and nail to have the Populist who wasn't supposed to win removed from office by every possible means and failing at every turn, and with an election looming in which the Establishment's chances of victory were looking slim, the COVID pandemic would end up delivering a game-changing revelation. They found that during a time of crisis, they had the ability to rewrite election laws on a whim, completely bypassing the normal legislative process, as long as they presented said changes as being in the interest of public safety. The plan worked like a charm; the Establishment was able to change the election rules in its favor mere weeks before voting day, and as a result it was able to take back control of the White House in an election that it had a high likelihood of losing otherwise.

Now the Establishment is working tirelessly to have Trump eliminated once and for all, utilizing anything and everything it can legally throw at him, to ensure he doesn't return to oppose it once again in 2024. And what happens if another Populist candidate starts to pose a direct threat to the Establishment's rule? Well, they've learned from 2020 that all they need to do is just artificially engineer another public crisis so they can change the election rules in their favor again. COVID may have been a purely serendipitous circumstance that they were able to capitalize on, but I'll guarantee you that should another crisis emerge during an election year in which the Establishment's authority is being directly challenged, it will be 100% deliberate.

So yeah, as long as you look at the American political divide as being Establishment vs. Populist rather than Democrat vs. Republican, our government really isn't all that different from Singapore's. We just add extra steps to the process to maintain the illusion that Americans still have free choice in their leadership, whereas the PAP has completely dropped the ruse and just openly admits that they'll do whatever it takes to ensure that they're the only party who ever holds any real power.",2021-10-11T22:19:47Z

All you have to do is to dissolve organizations and societies and banish and detain the key political workers in these societies. Then miraculously everything is tranquil on the surface. Then an intimidated press and the government-controlled radio together can regularly sing your praises, and slowly and steadily the people are made to forget the evil things that have already been done, or if these things are referred to again they're conveniently distorted and distorted with impunity, because there will be no opposition to contradict.“

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"While China is just a lazy version of Singapore, we are too lazy pretending to have a democracy. The common characteristics shared by Chinese and Singaporean Chinese is that we value economy over politics. No Chinese would like to waste as much tax money as the Americans do on election, even for those Chinese who actually want a more democratic government. It’s a waste of time. Chaos, that’s how mainland Chinese see Taiwan; order and prosperity, that’s how we view Singapore and we’ve been trying to build China according to the Singapore model with LEE Kuan Yew’s own advices, the founding father rod Singapore, an ethnic Han Chinese who hated democracy for good reasons. He once said that” democracy never brings progress.” I think likewise. What brings progress are the people who work on ideas and implement them. It’s never the president or politicians we talk and do nothing. That’s why we have so many engineers in our administration, those are the people who are trained to solve problems, not just talk about them. Japan is not a democracy, they are under the rule of the same party since the 1945. The ruling class of Japan are those same families since the Meiji era. It’s more like a blend of monarchy and oligarchy. The prime minister Abe’s uncle and grandfather were Japan’s prime minister before him. Western style democracy doesn’t work. Korea is a puppet state of its own companies, like Samsung and Hyundai, and those states are under Americans influence because they all have Americans shareholders on board. They can’t help throwing one president after another into prison after their presidential mandate. The only two good presidents of South Korea, one of them was defamed and he took his life, the other good one is seeking vengeance for him since they are brothers of different mothers. Taiwan is not vibrant democracy like the western media depict. The DPP, ruling party of Taiwan, was once the underdog. They claimed that they fight for a democratic and progressive Taiwan when KMT was in power. Now they beat KMT, they just started to crack down pro-China media and fine people big money (about 100,000 US dollar) who make negative comments on the party. It makes me laugh every time western media say that Taiwan is a vibrant democracy of Asia, it really is not and they know that, but they say it anyway. Simply because, as soon as Taiwan is a breakaway province to China, it can serve as a tool to contain China, both militarily and politically. It gives me nausea every time I see “president” Tsai’s face on TV, she’s a hypocrite and has done no good for the Taiwanese people, apart from cancelling nuclear energy projects and promising sufficient green energy, and never delivered. She told people to make electricity with love. I encourage Taiwanese to make love, not electricity, might save them from ultra low birth rate, even lower than Japan and Mainland China, the lowest in the world. Guess we mainlander should just wait them out. Half of their college student go to China for work anyway.",2021-10-07T21:55:50Z

In general, I simply don't like it when people with obvious political ideals think they are in any shape or form capable of educating or documenting other democracies without showing bias.

One of the things I noticed for instance was that 2020 democracy index. West europeans don't view europe as ""very democratic"" due to the technocracy of the EU and several nations themselves also having unfair systems in place. At the same time, a study conducted in the US, by the US and most likely by a biased outlet also can't be considered correct or unbiased with its results.

What was the main reason humans opted to stay in larger groups in their primitive days? If a government whatever type it may be provides economic prosperity, then clearly they're doing something right. 

I believe the rest of the world and you are just afraid of the phrase ""Power corrupts"". I've always believed that what ever means will always justify ends. Wipe out an entire country for world peace? Keep a dictatorship for stability and growth? I see no difference here. Their actions have been proven by their results, and they intend to solidify and protect those results. The issue here is if some random party gets the win and just destroys everything they've done just for the sake of democracy in turn setting a flame to the entire nation's prosperity.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"I think the flaw in this entire argument is that you assume singaporeans to have the same values and priorities as westerners. Although I can't speak for all singaporeans, i can say that most of us put the community above the individual. That's to say we don't prioritise our ""civil liberties"" like the right to protest, but rather prioritise communal things like healthcare, housing, jobs, economy, etc. I also take a bit of issue with the way you present your arguments. For example when you talked about the protest on the MRT, you made it sound outrageous that someone was charged for vandalism for ""only sticking a piece of paper on the train"", but to me as a singaporean, that IS vandalism, because the MRT is public property. It might not be a big deal to someone who prioritises the right to protest, but it matters to people like me who prioritise the state of the community. It is this kind of enforcememt that keeps people in check and upholds our standard of living. Even though this protest may have been small, if the government had allowed such behaviour to continue we'd likely be in a situation like america where protests every other day, which in a country as small as singapore would leave no small impact on the rest of the country.

Additionally, on the point that the PAP sabotages opponents and makes laws that favour them, yes the definitely do. And that is a major flaw of our democratic system. However, if you want to make the argument that singapore is a dictatorship compared to other democratic countries then that is not a valid argument, because sabotage and corruption happens everywhere around the world. And while the PAP definitely use underhanded tactics to increase their chances of winning, history has proven that when the people aren't happy with what the PAP is doing, they will vote them out of power. Just last year we had a very close battle between the PAP and the Worker's Party (Singapore's biggest opposition party) and in fact managed to get one of the worker's party candidates a seat in cabinet and the PAP acknowledged the opposition as a legit governmental party, even providing them with funds to run their GRCs. It might sound like a small and insignificant thing, but I think it not only shows progress towards a more even playing field but also shows how singaporean's do not simply allow the PAP to hold power. We let them because they do enough to ensure a good standard of living, and when the don't do that, people will turn against them.

So no, singapore is not a dictatorship. Just because we don't prioritise individual freedom does not mean we are being controlled.",2021-08-22T13:24:56Z

Government supporters would probably just tell us that we need to practise more austerity instead, which would be less deleterious to the economy in Singapore than other countries since the former rely less on domestic consumption (since many consumer goods we buy here are imported).

Just because something ""may"" happen does not mean Singapore needs to change right frickin' *now.*  The people are generally content, as repeated a hundred times in the video.  Singapore offers an incredibly high quality of life and that is what humans want, not ""an election that is fair by the standards of a person who does not live there.""

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"As a Singaporean, I wont really count Singapore as to the extent being run under a ""dictatorship"", due to the associated connotations. I prefer to see it as the primary reason why the PAP has enjoyed such longstanding power, is due to its ability to eke out very sucessful growth prospects for Singapore, as the ruling government. Political legitimacy is very much dependant on the ability of the incumbent government to do its job, and hence the agreed notion at 16:35. This is even more crucial when considering implementing certain maximum measures which although can in essence assure better stability in many constitutions of the country, are in nature undemocratic and raise the bar higher for the current government to prove its legitimacy.
Thus, SG is imo not really run by a dictatorship, nor is it a quintissential democracy. It is run instead by a key virtue, that of achieving a balance between democratic and maximum areas of governance - to institute a system providing freedom but not too much so as to lose control. Ultimately a country's govt system must be beneficial to the country and its citizens in the long term.",2021-08-12T10:04:53Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"I do agree with Dan comment, but on the other side of coin (as most countries have ""Democracy"") you place little power into the hands of too many people. In case of my experience - Hands of incompetent, ineffective, often delusional, very often corrupted, often perverted and so on people who often can't come into an agreement in any discussed subject. Level of bureaucracy increases. Even when you do s lot of things digitally. People are too misinformed and often incredibly dumb to make such important decision as voting for new-old government. This lack of knowledge benefits politicians. Let's not forget radicalism which gains popularity because of voters illiteracy, paranoia and narrow-minds. Instead of guide and enlightenment, we have dictatorship where if you don't know one of hundreds laws exactly as written in the book, then you will pay for it. They make more and more laws. More protection for politicians, less rights and benefits for citizens. Why would it be different? You voted for them. 
What I'm saying is that Democracy is not what you think it is (That is especially true for Americans). It died long ago. If my memory serves me right, Democracy means ""Power to the people"".

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"As a Singaporean, I kind of don't care. I'm not interested in politics, I'm forced to pay attention to it sometimes because it is necessary basis to interpreting other ongoing things in the world I have interest in. Most Singaporeans are pragmatic people. We like stability, the ability to deliver actual workable solutions, and the chance to live a honest live with dignity. So far the government has done fine in providing an environment for that. It's safe, comfortable, and often a bubble compared to the rest of the world. To be honest the covid situation is revealing some huge gaps, but overall they're managing it okay. 

Culture matters about the politics. Western cultures emphasizes individualism and hence holds democracy as the single best government method. LKY recognized that in the Asian context (culture and beginning socioeconomic state) we need our own democracy for it to work out well. We wanted growth because we were starving and in bad health. Now that the country is much more developed and very few of the population have concerned about shelter & food, plus the overwhelming influence of Western media & access to international discussion, then there is more driving conversation about the existing system. Younger voters like myself, increasingly, vote for whichever opponent party at election, even though we know it has low chances of turning the table (it did in the Sengkang GRC though haha). I'm not a fan of planning too ahead, but generally curious to see where we'd head towards.

My parents say I should consider moving to China looking at future job prospects, but tbh I prefer to stay in Singapore because at least you don't get blacklisted for bitching about the government (or meme-ing them online) lol.

However, my generation, the younger generation, want more accountability and social change like LGBT rights and etc and are voting for opposition we find credible or that can be moulded to take over the PAP as an alternative if they refuse to adapt.

The 2020 election was a sign of that. 

The shift in votes to the opposition was mostly with the GRCs with younger populations. We do not use the election just as a silent protest, but a platform to vote in and build the check and balance for the PAP to stay on the course for our country’s best interest, or be replaced by the next incoming best choice, which is looking out to be the Worker’s Party.

Because the consensus amongst the people still stands, without the leadership and guidance from LKY, we wouldn’t have succeeded this much as a country and become the envy of South East Asia.

The assertion of a 'political dynasty', however, is premature when considering the calibre of the two prime ministers Lee. They and their Cabinet have generally steered Singapore in the path of prosperity. Their abilities have shown that familial ties played little role in allowing them to retain power. It is also noteworthy that for all the power the PAP wields, media outlets do expose mistakes (e.g. the misuse of public money in purchasing excess of fitness trackers).

It still holds that a more educated, richer population will eventually demand more personal and political freedom. So, in essence, the Singaporean dictatorship is continuously digging its grave.
It will either have to become more totalitarian, get rid of the clever and wealthy, alienate its benefactors until it ends up as a part of a totalitarian empire (China is the most likely candidate), or its people will overthrow it at a point just to express their want for a choice.
In a grand scale, dictatorships are wasting humanity's resources, keeping people in the dark, and ensuring the demise of mankind as they will never be able to cooperate solving global problems like the air pollution that will kill humanity in the next 100 years if little changes on this front.

The problem is Singaporeans are getting complacent, with economic inequality being a chief problem, even if it cant be solved reducing its worst effects can go a long way.

This was Operation Coldstore. That pretty much left the political landscape clear until the 1980s. But once real political opponents showed up again, the PAP used the law as a weapon to effectively bankrupt political opponents. You need a deposit to run for a parliament seat.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Practical authoritarian government and dictatorship are two very different concepts. To conclude that Singapore is a dictatorship is fitting evidence to an already presumed narrative.

PAP IS held accountable for a lot of things. It is a biased imperative to think accountability can only be instituted by a powerful opposition.

The value of things like ""the right to protest"" become almost a religious, ritualistic paradigm. Often than not, protesting doesn't solve the problem the protesters want to address, and sometimes the motive to protest is questionable in the first place. There are many ways to reach the government in Singapore, and I have made a few requests. Guess what, my problem is solved without me having to protest on the streets. 

And no thanks, Singapore is democratic by legislation. The history of PAP's continuous reign doesn't change this fact. If PAP messes up, it can very well lose its power; the 2020 election already testified to that. LHL's ""strong mandate"" might be a bit braggy, but he has a point: PAP IS voted into office, and people vote for PAP because it's generally doing a good job. 

If the only way for you to imagine a democracy is in the like of forms such as Trump-Biden debate, a split 50/50 vote or political drama, then I have to say you have a very narrow, if not imperialist concept of democracy. Judging from the fact that you pronounce PAP as ""pipe"" instead of P-A-P, I will bet to reckon that you didn't consult any Singaporean before making this video. I mean come on, Singaporeans speak English and are easy to reach on social media.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"It's insane stuff. I talked to a singaporean young man, his upbringing was basically very controlled and regulated wealth (travelling the world basically on a basis on a country every two weeks to educate him immensely) and the most intense excruciating education you can think of for years uninterrupted all only to lead to a life of intense unwavering long sessions of work till the very moment of retirement.

The essence of making your entire life around economic generation and not stopping for a single moment to just live your life with the wealth you have instead of tirelessly working to move the economy and forget to be a human and be alive in between. 

As a western European I am deeply traumatized by his accounts and really thankful to be in a country where I can basically just chill and live (things like families on a sunny day on a huge grassy park with beautiful monuments, just laying down with their loved ones, and blowing bubbles and breathing the fresh air, and watching the leaves fall gently, and hearing the birds chirp as evening settles, and kids running around laughing, and youths sitting chatting with their significant other showing affection, and friends taking pictures next to the monuments, and an older person sitting in a stone bench watching it all and and and... you get the picture)

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"I live in Singapore. Born and bred. Here's the quick TLDR. 

Singapore is a country little bigger then the island of Manhattan. Singapore's living space is akin to Tokyo or Hong Kong. Tight. Singapore's elite class live in landed properties and condominiums, again where land is a high premium, are in walking distance to average people. It is in the best interest of the elite class to bring prosperity to everyone, lest an angry mob literary walk down to where they live. Everyone shares the cake. Funny thing enough, average people just want peace, security, stability and enough money, not all the money, but enough to live by. The takeaway for other countries = A family that lives together, stays together. Have your elites LIVE with and among ordinary average people. Have it such a way that is in the elite class best interest that EVERYONE be prosperous. Cultivate a sense of DUTY for the elite class to help bring prosperity to everyone. That's the key. And before this is dismiss as just a manifestation of the asian collective mindset, you see this sense of moral indebted duty of the elites to their society in the works of Adam Smith or interviews with Henry Ford. The words of Marcus Aurelius or Seneca, the speeches of George Washington. 

It is when the elite class is detach from average everyday people, do not feel kinship to their fellows in society, nor feel any moral obligation for their indebted standing in their society, dismiss the noblesse oblige, forsake the duty to God and Country, and instead seek to oppress and exploit their fellow men, that road to ruin begins. In Orwell's Animal Farm, it is when the intellectually gifted pigs started to live in the manor and not with their fellow animals in the barn, that the dystopia future began.

Quick Recommendation - Have your society's elites physically live with everyone, break bread with everyone, have it in their best interest to help everyone, then you will see positive difference in your society. That is my humble observation.",2021-07-12T08:32:02Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"I see a lot of naiveté in this assessment. The case of Singapore is reminiscent of Mexico in the 20th century, which was likewise technically a democracy but had only seen a single party in power from 1929 to 2000 - the PRI. Like the PAP, the PRI is essentially a technocratic, business-friendly party. Unlike the PAP, however, the PRI got to govern Mexico and draw its members from the Mexican population. It was corrupt, ineffective, and utterly failed to improve the lot of ordinary Mexicans - even despite intense American economic aid in the late Cold War, as the US feared that Cuba would ""export"" its socialist revolution to Mexico. When they were finally voted out, it was treated as a major milestone for Mexican democracy - indeed, as a confirmation that Mexico *was* actually a democracy, and there *could* be a clean handover. Did the result change anything beyond that, though? Not really. Mexico is still Mexico. It's still corrupt, ineffective, violent. It has been improving economically, but nowhere near the levels of the Singaporean model, nor does anyone imagine it would be capable of such a transformation. Which is to say, Mexicans asserted themselves and did use democracy to remove the PRI from power, but none of that changed the fundamentals of why Mexico is the way it is.

Singapore has an early trajectory that looks much like Mexico's after the Mexican Revolution, except that the PAP got to govern Singapore and draw its members from the Singaporean population. The PAP was clean and effective, and highly successful at improving the lot of ordinary Singaporeans. Generally speaking, when people see their situation improving so dramatically, they are disinclined to rock the boat. That is why the CCP currently runs a popular authoritarian regime. The PRI was voted out in Mexico because Mexico was performing poorly.

I'm sure it is true that people in Singapore treat elections a bit like an opinion poll, but that is not unique to Singapore. It happens in most established democracies and is called the ""protest vote."" I've done it myself. If you expect an established party to win, but you are not entirely happy with them and want to put pressure on them to move them more in your direction, you may vote for a more extreme party. Even though you are also not entirely supportive of everything the more extreme party advocates either, you don't expect them to actually *win*, so the intention is really to try to force a coalition to get some acceptable middle ground. It also happens that when such protest parties become big enough they often find that they suddenly lose support - when they become a real contender to govern, part of their electorate abandons them and returns to the more moderate party, what in Europe we call the ""safe pair of hands"", because they never intended for them to actually *govern*, only to condition the style of governance of the established party.

In order for an established party to actually be voted *out*, people's living conditions really just need to deteriorate and the country needs to perform poorly. Singapore, however, is not performing poorly. So it is just not reasonable to expect that people would want to change parties - as you acknowledge. Is authoritarianism really authoritarianism if it enjoys popular support? Is the thing that makes authoritarianism authoritarian really the ""what if"" question? ""What if"" things went poorly and they were voted out? Would they go quietly? That was the big question on people's minds in 2000 in the Mexican elections. And they did, more or less, go quietly.

Would the PAP go quietly? Who knows? Would the Democrats and Republicans go quietly in the USA? Who knows? Do they gerrymander their districts? They do. Do they stack the courts? They do.

But a context in which the PAP lost decisively, I'd imagine, would have to be one in which most Singaporeans became intensely dissatisfied. That would be a very different social context, one in which the PAP may very well find themselves asking, ""do we *want* to continue governing this mess?"" That also frequently happens in democracies. For example, in Spain, at the outset of the Great Recession, the ruling Socialist Party was voted out by people concerned they were spending too much - but they were actually *relieved* to be voted out, because they didn't want to have to be the ones to govern during the recession, and be blamed for the consequences of austerity. They thought it would hurt their brand and their image with their base. Better to let the opposition do it, and come out of hiding when they could offer something more enticing to voters than blood, sweat and tears.

Certainly I would agree that Singapore could do with some liberal social reform. It's unnecessary to arrest a guy for holding a smiley face sign. 3 years in prison is a totally disproportionate penalty for taping a protest sign on the metro car. On the other hand, like most of the world, Singapore has been witness to the implosion of many self-styled Western democracies in the past decade. I can imagine why they would be wary. Singapore does not want to fail, and Western democracies have been failing for a long time now.",2021-07-12T07:56:45Z

First off it didn't want to be independent, it was forced to. So, in order to make everything works, it had to ban everything and anything that gets in the way, like protests and communism parties. 
But, unlike the all dictatorship states, it does not blame a particular racial groups for the problem of Singapore. in fact they force you to live with different racial groups to reduce segregation and misunderstandings, far different from other nations like USA or even Hong Kong. Even India and African nations could not solve their own racial problems with different tribes. 

Yes I disagree with some measures it took on protesters like arresting someone for illegal assembly for being alone etc. But if you compare with other countries, Singapore still provides a large enough house at no less than 400spft (which is larger than Hong Kong, an island that is bigger than SG), provides you resources for you do well academically to pursue your aspiration, and so on.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Some will liken our country to a gilded cage, a utopia of near perfection shielded from any perils from within and without. You can literally sleep on our streets at 3am at night naked, with no fear of anyone molesting you. (though, someone might film and then call the police on you - our neighbors are no-life busybodies) If you're loaded enough, you would love it here. Just buy a citizenship with some $400k contribution. Free speech? Who needs free speech when there's free Wifi at almost every public facilities, clean water that you can drink right out of the tap, electricity that run 100%, near 90% punctual trains and buses, and free Covid vaccination for every citizen? It's literal heaven here even if you compare it to our neighbors just across the Causeway - and Malaysia is no shanty-town when compared to the rest of Asia, I can tell you. That and with no natural disasters, we're literally living in a man-made materialistic heaven.

Now that we'd got the bragging out of the way, let's discuss the real issue at stake here: What does Democracy even mean. Karl Marx consider it the precursor to Socialism and then Communism (an eerie possibility when you look at the current USA and Western Europe), Benjamin Franklin likened it to two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch. Mark Twain remarked that if voting mattered, you can bet that 'they' won't let you do it. Stalin said that it's the people who counted the vote that decide everything. The list goes on. I have no wish to debate on what 'democracy' actually means, but the fact that Singapore holds an election where the electorate is given a choice and is under no compulsion (physically or psychologically) to vote for the ruling party qualifies it as a Democracy and not a Dictatorship by my book. Sure, there are a million hurdles for an opposition to qualify and overcome, sure, people cry foul over 1 day changes, but hey, the same winner takes all rule apply to every party. 


As a Singaporean, I have my doubts about the actual pretensions of the ruling party. I can't say that living in a paradise makes for very capable or talented citizens either - as evidenced by the lack of local talents. (But we are rich enough to buy them, just like how we buy our maids and cleaners from our less affluent neighbors, and no, I'm not proud of that fact). But when you travel enough and compare it with the rest of the world, I can't help but be convinced that what the West calls 'democracy' looks scarcely more than a poorly played musical-chair for the power-hungry, the clinically insane and the morally bankrupt. Communism had fallen, but that did not automatically make Democracy the only perfect form of governance that should be enforced everywhere. I personally think that Democracy only works in tiny communities where everyone knows each other by name and are neighbors to their leaders; any population bigger than that, we have no way to make leaders accountable since they can always dodge their responsibilities behind all sorts of fringe groups or mobs.",2021-07-10T17:11:22Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"It’s true that the PAP has managed to hold on to it’s massive majority through some unfair policies, but what this video ignores is that the real reason why the PAP wins so much is because of it’s success rate. The PAP successfully brought Singapore from third to first world, despite being disadvantaged in many ways. It’s unparalleled success, along with the unmatched political skill of Lee Kuan Yew, resulted in most of Singapore having a great deal of faith in the PAP, which is earned. If you see it that way, it becomes clear why the PAP has dominated, and why it’s losing ground now, as younger citizens who didn’t live through the 20th century are less connected to the PAP’s past achievements. The fact that this is consistently happening (the PAP losing ground) despite all those additional advantages the PAP has actually proves the opposite of what this video tries to claim; Singapore is not a one-party state. A truly authoritarian PAP would’ve kept those votes up in the high 70 percents, and could’ve. Instead there have been the usual promises and occasional gerrymandering, but really, that happens everywhere. 

It would be something else if the PAP were incompetent or inefficient and still kept up that winning rate, but they aren’t. They have been effective and clearly what they’ve done has worked. So why change it? If there really was an unpopular leader or decision, there are enough citizens who would be willing to switch their vote to the opposition party. That’s why there really haven’t been any unpopular leaders or decisions. The PAP often takes the safest way through.

Can the system be improved? Yes, most definitely.

The video is right about one thing: the relationship between the people and the government is transactional. There is no party loyalty (eg. we don't identify ourselves as democrats/republicans like the US) and the ruling party knows this. Which is why they have been consistently performing up to standard because if they don't and cause the people to suffer a decline in the tangibles mentioned earlier, they can expect a poorer mandate in the next term or worse, be voted out.",2021-07-10T13:33:26Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Say what you will, but the fact that Singapore is an isolated ""City-State"" of ~6 million people is a very important consideration. It is a small, highly dense self-governing entity and that has a whole lot of impact on the ability for opposition to make a case and the ease at which one group can keep power. You see it pretty much all over the rest of the world, too - typically large, dense urban centers will have the same political leadership and affiliation for several decades and very rarely have changes.

Despite its diversity, that's a whole lot of people packed into a fairly tight place. I also know that there is a WHOLE lot of propaganda that surrounds that country, and when I was there you could sense a general tension from certain parts of the population - especially if you went to the more ethnic-centric areas like the Indian quarter where people seemed to ignore the ""littering"" laws (that are terrifying - the laws, not the people). 

Essentially, Singapore is no different from any other major city, except it has no larger government that can supersede it and it incredibly reliant of foreign interest to maintain any level of relevancy - It cannot mount any real defense or offense against any real geopolitical power if they piss them off. The same can be said for the population - if there is any level of stability drop, its going to tumble hard because there is no way for them to deal with problem otherwise.

Calling Singapore a corporation is probably the most accurate statement you could make.
I would also argue that ALL governments are corporations (as they tend to apply corporatist economic philosophy and thinking - which is all about control), but thats rather a seperate discussion.",2021-07-09T14:53:40Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Great video! Nice to show people the true Singapore government. There was also a video of one of our ministers, Chan Chun Sing, had leaked footage of a party meeting about how they can only survive as a ruling party if they continue to choose to call for elections during crises such as the passing of our founder Mr Lee Kuan Yew and most recently, last year, COVID. There is also reason to believe that last years election was rigged with the polls closing later than scheduled without telling opposition party members, the ballots taking way longer than usual to reach the counting station and even an opposition volunteer who claimed that when the polls where closed, all opposition volunteers where told to go into a room for a while and no one told them what they were doing. It was very suspicious especially when the claims were immediately silenced. Those GRCs and SMCs expected to go to opposition were somehow won easily by PAP.  The Election Department is controlled by PAP, the Singapore Police Force is also run by PAP. 
Recently, they have also been pushing for people to take the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, saying they allow the Sinovac vaccines but when they start introducing special safe management measures (SMM) for the vaccinated, they do not include those vaccinated with Sinovac. This is likely because they invested in companies which helped produce the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and need to profit. 
When they want to introduce unpopular measures, they always start by saying “it’s optional”, but like the Trace Together (TT) token/app, which we use to track close contact with COVID cases, eventually they make it mandatory. Same will probably happen with the vaccines. The TT was unpopular because it is basically a tracking device. The pro-PAP say that “if you got nothing to hide, why are you worried”, but this is simply an invasion of privacy. 
To summarise, the government is corrupt",2021-07-09T14:53:21Z

Low Crime/Corruption rate, checked. Racial harmony, checked. Education, checked. Efficiency in Public Services, checked. Low costs/inflation in food/necessities, checked. I might have missed some areas, but you get the idea. The majority of Singaporean voted for PAP(pronounced as the acronym P.A.P, NOT pap), for so many decades, is because the government has improved the lives of the people in all these areas. Voters should only vote for the opposition if they think that the ruling party is not efficient in governing the country. And that the opposition could do a better job. Voting for the opposition simply because the PAP has been in power for too long would be a silly and an impulsive mistake. There are too many inaccuracies in this video. It is a shame.

It’s more of the parents’ fault actually, being mainly Asians and overly protective and unwittingly blinded their children.  I don’t love the PAP, but I have respect and gratitude for all that they have done for Singapore and for our people.  I don’t love Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, but he has my highest respect and gratitude and few people in the world will debate he is one of the greatest and most respected leaders in the world in modern history.  Singaporeans need to go out and see the world, and learn to cherish what our forefathers built for us, because we’re starting to lose our competitiveness and it’s accelerating if we as individuals forming this tiny nation don’t get our mindset right and whine like giant babies.  Weather is no good, blame the government.  Things don’t go the way you want, blame the government.  Objectively measuring government deliverables in terms of the most basic human rights - food, shelter, safety, health care, extensive and affordable public transport network, economic security to live with basic dignity, clean and hygienic environmental conditions, holidays overseas at least once a year is affordable for the average Singaporean, you name it, few governments in the world deliver what our government delivered, with no resources other than our leaders and slogging forefathers, in the past 60 years or so.  All these are the fruits we enjoy from the labors of our “dictator PAP” and forefathers.  Most people bitchin’ about lack of democracy or flaunting about their democracy are pretty clueless what they are talking about...but that’s too long to write here.  Singapore has a democratic system in place, with negligible corruption in the political elite.  PAP as the dominant party has done a great if not fantastic job by any objective statistical measure, which probably explains why opposition party has little to oppose except for the nitty gritties and explains why opposition parties are so weak. And to be candid, they cannot perform better than PAP even if they are give the chance to lead Singapore.  Period.  I used harsh words here because we need wake up calls.  Singaporeans should open our eyes, travel to see and experience the world, not as tourists seeking entertainment but see the real world.  Try walking the streets late night in CBD New York or L.A.  Ok I’m joking don’t try that you may put your life in danger.  Go see the major cities in China and see what the “evil CCP regime” has done for its people and see how much we are lagging already.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,Finally there's someone pointing this out,2021-07-08T11:01:17Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Democracies have proven, again and again, that voters are not informed, or rational. They tend to fall for fake news, populist promises, vote along very narrow interests, or very short term gain, or against their interests entirely. This leads to parties funneling resources into their supporters and interest groups, rather than into investments the common good. Especially if the benefits from the investments are long term and will be felt by the next administration. Tax cuts and stimulus bring political points now, deficits be damned.
Dictatorships have, on average, fared even worse. With no accountability they are incentivized to pour resources into the security forces that keep them in power, turn to mass surveillance, oppression, torture, and personal enrichment, often leading to lack of long term investments. Even if a leader is competent, and benevolent enough to do the right thing, there is no guarantee the one after that will be as good, and there is no system to remove him in time.
Singapore is about as good as it can get when you fuse the two. On one hand, it is not a dictatorship, it has free elections and accountability, the system is in place to remove the people from power if they mess up royally. Contrast this with China, Vietnam, North Korea - or even the dictatorships of past South Korea and Taiwan - where protests did nothing. On the other hand, Singapore has the practical advantages of dictatorships, with long term planning and stability.
If an opposition party wins elections in Singapore, they will have to govern with zero experience on how to do it. History shows such cases to mess up very bad, with no guarantee the PAP will be able to clean up the mess in their successive mandate.
Of course, the best course depend on one's priorities. The Western ideals of ""Give me liberty, or give me death"", where poverty while ""free"" is preferable to a well managed, tightly controlled society, would indicate that Singapore should have regular peaceful transfers of power, even if this leads to a loss of prosperity and stability. Eastern ideals of the interests of the community being greater than the interests of the individuals, would say the quality of life is the proof this system is working as intended. Whether you want to call it Mandate of Heaven, or a Social Contract, but it is nothing new.
I would personally say Singapore should have much greater freedom of speech and right to protest, but apart from that a party that has shown it can govern competently should not be removed from power.",2021-07-08T11:00:48Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"In my humble opinion, Dictatorship itself is not bad as long as the dictator is wise and kind. We still idolize the great kings, such as ""King Aurther"", ""Charlemagne"", ""King Solomon"" etc. (Technically speaking, they were also dictators too.) The problem of Dictatorship is not the problem of holding the power alone. The problem of Dictatorship is how to make sure the one who holds the power is wise and kind. In Plato's ""Republic"", he strongly emphasized a country can be developed well if and only if the the ruler is capable, wise and kind. That's where Democracy comes in. We simply do not know who is wise and kind, and who is capable enough to rule a country. We simply do not know. Can I rule the country? Can you rule? Or others? So, democracy is simple like: tell us who are interested in ruling the country, and let us determine who is the right one, and if what we selected is not the right one, we will ditch him and reelect another one. But Singapore's System is different in that it is based on Meritocracy: not only in politics but also in everywhere. Because the only resources the Singapore has is Human Resources. It is why it will always make sure the Power will always go to the right one, because they know once the power is in the wrong hand, it will be a disaster. Actually, what people really hate is not Dictatorship; but the Incompetency, Selfishness, Cruelty, which the dictatorship can possibly bring up. So, as long as the dictatorship can guarantee Capability, Wisdom and Kindness, it is not a problem. Look at China and Vietnam. Yes of course, they have to make sure the Power always go into the right hand... If not, then all the best... Democracy, in my humble opinion, is not the will of the people. It is a system to select who is capable, wise and kind enough to rule the country. And again, there is a break-down for the Democracy too. If whoever we select is equally bad, incapable and cruel, then it is the disaster for Democracy as well. For example, Athene, the Greek City, was prospered due to Democracy but it was destroyed due to Democracy as well. That's why Plato wrote the Republic: it is to make sure the rulers are always wise, capable and kind.",2021-07-08T10:10:56Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"4:04 Operation Coldstore — these people were arrested for ‘communist activities’ and ‘spreading communist ideals’. Many of them protested against their arrest, claiming that they truly were not communist and had done nothing related to communism. It’s still possible to find the video recording of Lim Chin Siong saying that with confidence. However, they were detained without trial, with no court to hear their sides. It was claimed that there was evidence found against them; however, these evidence were never revealed or talked about to public. Furthermore, some of them were in PAP originally — Lim Chin Siong and Fong Swee Suan started as student activists from a Chinese Highschool and had a lot of influence over the Chinese population in Singapore at that time, so they played a huge part in getting the Chinese to vote for PAP. Once PAP was voted in, they were arrested and thrown into jail. Operation Coldstore — or at least, brief details of it —  is now taught in Singapore’s secondary school history syllabus.",2021-07-08T09:09:19Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"@16:24 NY never actually banned soda. There was a proposed law that never went into effect because it was rightfully struck down by the courts. The courts enforcing the law to prevent such overreach is a pretty big difference in the way the two countries handle such things.

(Also, it wasn't so much of a ban on soda, as a limitation on how large of a cup they could sell you, and only applied to restaurants, not grocery stores, you would have still been able to get the stuff and drink it freely in public)

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Depends on how one defines 'accountability'. In Singapore the political system is held accountable to the promises that they make by the outcomes that they deliver, which if successfully done necessarily means that there are effective checks and balances in place including in the form of opposition voices. They are held accountable by a well educated, well informed, sophisticated, cosmopolitan, highly skeptical populace - the population are not mindless, subordinate drones, and their outcomes in social factors like housing, education, healthcare, how safe women feel walking outside at night etc. makes it easy to argue why 61% keep voting the same way.

In contrast, the author of this video defines accountability simply as 'the ability for an opposition view to be heard at the point of campaigning'. Their definition pays no bearing on what outcomes are actually delivered or even whether there is any effective checks and balances in operation. There are many political systems in the world where this is the case, i.e. where many opposing views are shared but they fail to deliver on any promised outcomes - to the author this would still make for a more 'accountable' state than Singapore.

In the Singapore system, they don't make promises that they know they can't keep and they have seldom failed to deliver outcomes on promises that they do make. If they stop doing that then the system would change overnight because, as the video pointed out, the elections are free and the system is non-corrupt.",2021-07-07T22:23:25Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Ugh. Nice effort, I guess? Next time I hope the algorithm filters out hyperbolic nonsense and opinions on what makes a place ‘one of the most comfortable places to live on the planet.’

So if I pretend like I learned something here….like there are certainly roots going back many moons that have contributed to Singapore’s current condition. But you are like SUPER mega impressed by the BOOM BOOM happy past 30 years especially? Good to know. 

Let’s look at some (since the government refuses to release demographic details of its non-resident population) DATA that doesn’t involve ‘comfiness.’  

Fertility rate is ranked 200 out of 200.  It was dead last in 2018 before surging past Hong Kong, Moldova and Taiwan, now its back home at 200 of the 200 nations ranked by the UN Population Division.  

Oh but it’s educational attainment and the high status of women (bullshit) that has slowed down the procreation! 200 out of 200. Now those three ethnic groups that you claim all live in some symbiotic harmonious equal public palace. It’s four. ‘Others’ or those damn North American/European types we are renting to teach us (insert here).  More importantly it is Chinese 77% Malay 14.8% Indian 7%.  

The non-resident immigrant population (you DO NOT VOTE. Didn’t find this relevant while explaining the streets are sparkly clean because of party tenure?) was:

1970: 40,000 1%
2005: 800,000 18.3%
2010: 25.7%
Mid-2010s Estimated over 40%
2022 SingStat stopped talking about this years ago for some reason. I’ll just be like you and say…..99% non residents. 

Now if I meant that last part literally it would really take away any credibility momentum I think I had built up thus far yeah? 

Why are we talking about the GDP of Qatar? Do you want to run away son? Are you just obsessed with the future of being an expat. The Qatari ECONOMY is just a slight bit singular is it not?  Oh and the whole population of 2.6 million people and only 300,000 are actually Qatari! 

This isn’t worth my time. You need to put it together for yourself. ‘Protests are illegal and that’s bad mmmk’ does not amount to your video being well-rounded. If you want to focus THAT much of the beginning to elections, how about you mention in the last 20 years the population that can’t vote has grown from 15% to over 50%.  The birth rate of the minority Malay population is double that of the Chinese and Indian.  

Why have kids when you are not going to be welcome in the near future (Indians) or you already began menopause (Chinese).  Haven’t you seen the funny commercials Denmark runs about getting laid? ‘DO IT FOT DENMARK’ they are quite hilarious. 

Final ranking. Population density and comfort. You may have heard that those with the resources to flock to suburbia have been doing so across the U.S. (even the hipster whites).  

Singapore has the 2nd highest population density of anywhere in the world. Only Monaco.

NOT anywhere near comfortable.  Flip a coin? Can I even vote? Or am I just another Indian slave. I bet Singapore WILL give you your passport back before making you ‘work off your debt’ unlike the Qataris you are so eager to compare them to.",2021-07-07T16:04:33Z

Now, free from the British, he backstabbed his Malaysian ally by inciting racial tension between Chinese and Malays that culminating in his 'moment of anguish' (what a solid actor..) and separation from Malaysia.

Banks do not extend loans to apartments with 60-65 years left on them 3. Begging is illegal and SG does not any state welfare, hence underprivileged often do not have means to live a dignified life.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,Surprised this isn’t blocked in Singapore ok I’m kidding,2021-07-07T07:36:18Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"A “successful dictatorship?” If you’re starting by qualifying that a government is a dictatorship— i.e. that the people themselves are completely marginalized from political power, disenfranchised, & have to live under an autocratic ruler who is not accountable to them & can legally just decide to revoke whatever rights they ostensibly still have, brutalize anyone in the country who they deem an inconvenience, impose any injustice or horror they choose to (which they absolutely 1,000% will do if the people ever start to organize to oppose dictates of the dictatorship’s authority & demand their right to govern themselves democratically, to have a say in the laws & public policies of the country they live in)— then at that point you’re really undermining the significance of the word “success.” It raises serious questions about what even qualifies as “success” for a dictatorship.

Like… To a dictator, success is largely just holding onto power by whatever means necessary, silence your opposition by crushing them into submission, & enjoying the power & wealth your autocratic rule— almost always as a crony of the ultrawealthy who maximizes their profits in return for kickbacks & letting them write/influence the laws & public spending for their own benefit, or in the case of Leninist/ML dictatorships, basically just reproducing the power of the political class (in the form of the Leninist vanguardist Communist Party who runs the dictatorship) & maybe building some social infrastructure to put a floor under the suffering of the masses. Do we mean exclusively economic success? & if so do we just mean they maximize GDP or growth (in which case China & the USSR were by far the most “successful” dictatorships)? Do we mean social indicators like childhood malnutrition, starvation, homelessness, mortality rates, unemployment, lack of extreme wealth inequality, per capita income, poverty, extreme poverty, deprivation of healthcare, education, drug addiction (& whether it gets treated), self-sufficiency, human rights, the condition of social safety nets, wages, the degree of labor organization, the class character of the government… I certainly think these are better metrics than the metrics for how “successful” a state is than the metrics most fetishized by capitalists— GDP, growth (there’s food growth & bad growth), & profit margins, which really are only certain to indicate that the wealthy made a killing, even if that means hundreds of millions of others slaving away for insane hours in workplaces they have no  & living in an unhealthy state of deprivation & desperation until they die early. Certainly some countries may measure well in some of these areas & poorly in others, so it’s hard to draw very strong comparisons, which may be frustrating, but the reality is that the economy & society are extremely complex, multivariate things & we need multiple dimensions to give a meaningful qualitative picture of one, so I think they’re worth looking at. 

It’s also essential that you judge things in their historical context— if a state was governing a poor, broken, undeveloped feudal agricultural economy when it took power, they might be the most successful state of all time, but they aren’t going to have as good static metrics for social indicators at a rich, developed country which was already rich & well-developed when the other country was starting out— success is relative & our judgements have to reflect the historical material context; whatever metric you’re measuring, strong progress in the right direction is success. By those kinds of human well-being oriented social indicators I’d guess that somewhere like Cuba under Fidel Castro & soon after (or some other Latin American left-wing dictatorships) would do quite well, other than negatives on human rights/personal freedoms & democracy, obviously which will obviously be inherently true of any dictatorship. And we could mean any number of other metrics, or if we account for multiple metrics we might weight & prioritize them very differently, or even be inclined to measure them differently, depending both on bias & methodology.",2021-07-07T07:35:05Z

But ironically our ""democracy index"" kept falling steadily since 2014, the year people voted for a change. 
Our present government isn't perfect, but it's better. The fact that i could even write this comment, using internet is because of this government. We are slowly but steadily building up, the place where i live, finally have proper roads,  drinking water and electricity (these were impossible few years back). One of the reason might be, the present government doesn't bow to outsiders any more, foreign relationships are good though, but needlessly putting down our country, by the foreign press came to a significant halt, they have to think twice now. 
However though I personally think democracy will always be the best alternative, I wonder whether dictatorship with the present government, can maybe take India to new heights.

Then, common methods (gerrymandering, voter suppression, media ""in the pocket"" of, OK, not one but two, parties guaranteed to stay in power) Singapore shares with the US.

The reason most dictatorships fail is because they are either communist (North Korea, China, USSR) and/or have a low IQ population (African dictatorships fail even when they are capitalist).

 Spain under Franco (despite his flaws) was successful after his free market reforms. Read about  the Spanish miracle. Hitler (obviously he did bad things we all know about) built up Germany and Hitlers war machine could only be stopped when other countries ganged up on them. There are many other examples of right wing dictatorships being successful despite the human rights abuses they often have.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,Singapore's leadership is characterized as a benevolent dictatorship like a parental relationship of a morally strict father to it's citizens. No one can deny Singapore's success. The two criticisms on how strict their current standards are and a fear of a future corrupt government misses the point that the current government is simply an extension of the collective strict Asian value family systems in Singapore. Most Singapore families raise their children with a strict no nonsense approach and this broadly appeals to the selection of their elected leaders. This stands true for any society if their overall moral and value system deteriorates so will their elected leaders.,2021-07-06T16:30:34Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"But when its obvious that people live good and wealthy with this government, then why change it? The guys in charge right now really care about the country, are experienced and do their job better than almost all other governments in the world. Any other partly would destroy it all in a single year, because, since they are in power for a short term they will use every opportunity to grab and steal money, meaning, be corrupt.
When a government knows that they have a lot of time ahead, they don't focus on their own profit, but rather on the profit of the country.
Elections force politicians to be corrupt, as they see being in charge for 3-4 years as their rare opportunity to grab on to the country's treasury. They don't care about what will happen to the country after they are gone, the next government is left to deal with it.",2021-07-06T16:29:58Z

Your criticism that this country is a “thin procedural hollow, proxy bureaucratic democracy"" is simplistic and flawed. Many of my contacts from the expat community are glad to be here and they hold the country in high regard. 

Witnessing the chaos and divisive politics in America, will Singapore be better off adopting Western Liberal Democracy? The dire consequences and resulting damages would be unimaginable. 

Violent protests in Hongkong and January 6 Capitol Hill riots are recipes for failure if that occur in this tiny island-state. Therefore, isolating Hong Lim Park for demonstrators to air grievances under a controlled approval process was a stroke of genius. 

Many factors can undo Singapore success story. We must not take for granted the prosperity and peace we enjoy, bearing in mind the mess that pervades countries with less competent governments.

You still get to elect the individual politicians based only on their own merits! And independents! They just don't get any votes because the Vietnamese voters are fervent communists! It is in fact no less diverse than the US two-party system where two parties only pretend to be two different parties! And it is all supervised by a commission of delegates from all parts of society, so it is in fact even *more* democratic than any western country! And of course any local who calls the system dictatorial only does so because they are a fascist who has been paid off by foreign meddlers...
Or so it goes. 

The problem with studying any political system is that it is hard to get an assessment from anyone who has not some sort of stake or bias in the matter.

Where we differ from Singapore is the fact that we are quite far from authoritarian and we are by no means sosio-economically as well off as Singapore. This is partly due to the effects of Apartheid still being VERY prominent and also due to a incredible amount of corruption and mismanagement by the ANC causing a worsening economic situation year over year.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"I normally enjoy watching PolyMatter videos but this video really annoyed me. Besides some of the factual errors and miscontextualization (e.g. over personality cults, or charges of excessive gerrymendering), off the top of my mind, the issue with this video is that:


1) it presupposes that the only righteous form of a democracy (never mind that Singapore is _actually_ a democracy) is the American model where who is in power must oscillate.. and there must be a strong opposition/checks & balances/clash of ideas

2) it preaches the idea that given that since the singapore democracy is so dominated by a single party and therefore far from the american model, the party in power must do this completely unnatural and unprecedented thing of going out of the way to enable and help the opposition parties.. even though singapore goes WAY further to ensure everyone has a vote (voting is mandatory, voting day is a public holiday, there are tons of voting sites, etc.).. 

3) of course, number 2 conveniently ignores what is happening in the US where one party is openly engaging in even more blatant and open gerrymandering and voter suppression, on the basis that the Republican party will never hold power if elections were truly open/free/fair/democratic 

4) and with #1, it also ignores the recent problems with the American democracy which saw the rise of Trumpism, alternative facts, where actual expertise and competence is demonized, and you can be openly corrupt and exhibit actual authoritarianism tendencies but still get away with it scot-free. In spite of all this problems, @PolyMatter still righteously declares , if the Singapore government were wiser, it would move to be closer to being like the American or British forms of democracy.

Of course, the PAP is far from perfect and far from being above criticism, but this video is in no way that nuanced and instead still exhibits the typical American-style missionary mindset and self-righteousness, in spite of all the teething problems with the health of her own democracy at home.",2021-07-06T10:00:18Z

There is a flawed and conceited view in the west that only their concept of democracy is morally and ethically correct. They think it’s healthy to keep 2 competing opposite parties and dangerous to let one party dominate. In fact the Americans are so paranoid they don’t even want to give up their guns, just in case they need to fight the government! 😂

Subsequently, what you get is 2 parties constantly fighting each other and completely ignoring their duty to the people and dividing the population down the party line. America is more divided than ever now and won’t surprise me if there is a civil war in 20-30 years time. 

Singaporeans in the other hand said - “no thank you, we like to use common sense, we don’t play woke politics or virtue signalling, patronising Human Rights rubbish and we’ll do what is best for Singapore. We don’t buy the selfish “personal freedom” ideology, which is the hallmark of the western democracy because we believe in collectivism. Much better for progression and social harmony” 

That’s why Singapore is so successful and it also helps when your founding father is the best nation builder in the history of mankind and he has left them a great foundation, principles and a political model which has served them almost perfectly in all department! Why would they change? They hit the lottery with LKY and he had no time for left or right of politics. He preferred common sense and meritocracy.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Many defensive comments from Singaporeans.  Many Singaporeans choose to live outside of Singapore (including here in Australia), because of the freedom from State Supervision.  So much secret & not so secret censorship is common in S'pore.  Some international publications need to produce a censored version, just for their local market.
The ""Singlish"" used there does not conform to the standards of normal English pronunciation, which may be North American or British.  This is obvious when trying to spell out the names of their subway stations.  Generally they refuse to allow innovation, experimentation and unusual behavior of any type.  Traditional ""nice"", ""polite"" behaviors only.  This stunts the standards of research & governance.  Lack of political freedom, via peaceful, non-confontative behavior, is the norm.  LGBTIQ has been just a tip of this social & intellectual repression.
LKY like myself, and Australia's Foreign-Minister in-waiting (Penny Wong), are of the Hakka race.  Like ""European"", we ""Chinese"" really are more than 100 ""races"", each with their own cultures & languages.
Hakka know that infrastructure is more important than superficial retail WYSIWYG.  Taiwan & the pre-Mao China network are also Hakka, the gypsy land-farmers, circulating around East Asia.  Communist China was ""lost"" in the world of pre-industrial living, until it decided to follow Singapore (mainly) into a version of international commerce.
Personally, my current specialization is now superstructures, not materialistic sub-structures.  This planet is still lost in these worlds of cognitive sciences.  All nations world wide fail to understand that cognition applies to all intelligence, human or not.  So this YouTube video is worthwhile, like most non-academic publications.",2021-07-06T06:55:41Z

What it started off on the ISA detaining is very true then... as well as the current many defamation cases still in the process...
But what it failed to to catch is the mood on the ground...

Opposition lack good mind (I'm not saying current gen leaders are the best), and most of the time accusing individuals instead of the government is the main cause those dissents get pulled into the defamation cases... but finally from the last election, we saw blinking lights at the end of a tunnel with stronger opposition that is capable of better reasoning without going down the slippery slope of individual defamation.

In recent years, there had been louder voices from different groups on many of the government's issues that does not touches on individuals. Which you can see them flying almost everywhere without getting banned or pulled out from the news. These are the major issues that the local cares and wanted changes and had gotten the changes and enhancements that they hope for (not in full form, but good enough to move forward and revisit again later)

Finally, us being Asian is that we like stability... if gahmen do well, we continue to support them... if they are terrible, we will ""hint"" for a change... and if it is not happening, then we will slowly push them out (as in Malaysia's case)... For us, this is good enough freedom as long as we're not being monitored a-la-china-dictatorship-style and we do not need the extreme freedom a-la-american/european-stlye as we don't want things burned down or streets get locked down that will further cause us inconvenience (look back at Little India's 2013 incident).

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Nice presentation, but I think a lot of additional contexts are required. In the case of Singapore, size does matter: (I am very much opposition, labour if possible)
1) The PAP can't do what most dictatorship do. Singapore is a draft country, there's no significant separation between military from civilian that can effectively create a military regime. Most male and some female are once the military, law-enforcement or civil defense. So civic is the only path for them. Undoubtedly they are competent to *a point,* very quick to correct mistake, and that is how they keep power for so long, despite not being particularly popular (for precisely the reason in the clip). They are undemocratic, but they are by and large competent. 

2) Size does particularly matter because it's so small and dense that short of fleeing the country, there is no where to hide shit. It's not like in a large nation where you can have multiple rural vs urban community. Or where the problems of the masses becomes out of sight, out of mind. When something big happens, everyone felt it. Unlike say the US where you can outright have one state denying reality happening in another state. It is a lot easier to get consensus of action for the obvious. Also why the PAP are very quick at correcting mistakes.

3) It is not correct to say they manufacture crisis. Singapore is a tiny island with insufficient resources, geography being everything. Our prosperity is tied to globalism, it is not too much to say being globalist is our nationalism. The survivalist mentality is probably the only thing that everyone agrees about. As much as nations can be friends, there is no one we can depend on. That is actually a mentality you can thank the British for. 

Lee Hsien Long is not his father, but I have more sympathy for him because he is navigating in a time of increasing global instability. The rise of China, Pax Americana waning. The increasingly unstable economic models. etc. etc. Those are not manufactured crisis. Singapore don't have the luxury of serious international mistake.",2021-07-06T04:57:45Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"What's often left out of political discourse in the West is: is democracy really the only and ultimate evolution of governance of our civilization? In the 21st Century previously well-run democracies started struggling due to the rise of populism and anti-intellectualism. It really seems democracies have failed to adapt to the post-truth world fueled by social media. Malicious actors within the state have their voices amplified and there's nothing to effectively stop those harmful disinformation due to the need to be 'democratic'. The western style of democracy currently has no guarantee that it won't elect a radical, fascist leader that will bring ruins to the nation and the world in the very near future. 

The argument against authoritarian form of governance is that there is no guarantee that an enlightened/competent/benevolent ruling class will keep making optimal decisions. Even highly competent rulers eventually make mistakes due to short-sightedness of human beings. But with the rise of artificial intelligence it really seems possible that politics can be optimized and the self-correction mechanism can be done by algorithms instead of political debate. We might in the not so distant future no longer need humans in politics. It will be the ultimate form of enlightened dictatorship.",2021-07-06T04:41:47Z

Also how electorally, the opposition WP has broken through the Group Representation Constituency (GRC) hurdle that you briefly mentioned, taking not 1 but 2 GRCs at the recent elections. This is inspite of all the aforementioned disadvantages.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"The Dictator's Handbook has an interesting bit about Singapore. It cites it as the only example of a benevolent dictatorship actually working.

The book frames political decisions as individuals needing to win over keys to power who then must use that power to maintain the support of their keys (typically either the military or key voting blocs).

Under that model, leaders who wish to retain power must spend most of their resources keeping those keys happy and can spend the rest on whatever they want. Typically, that takes the form of corruption/personal enrichment. Singapore is unique because they ""waste"" money improving the lives of the citizens beyond what is necessary to maintain their grip on power.",2021-07-06T00:39:02Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"I can't imagine people rated this video with 23k vs 1k thumbsups. The fact that you started your argument with ""US has one of the best democracies in the world"" chart - and we all know what kind of circus US democracy, the elections they hold and all that are - you just totally and utterly destroyed the very foundation of your reasoning. Your so called ""example countries"" are mostly rotten to the core. It's even worse that ancient S.P.Q.R. senate was - and we all know how that ended. All this aside, I can't see what one could compare Singapore's lack of democracy to. Whole world is a shit fest. 

On the other hand, it's actually nice to see a new experiment PAP is carrying out. Ultimate eventuality of this experiment doesn't real look promising, but at least we can see a lot of things there actually work. A lot more than it does in your ""top democratic countries"". One thing is true about life: if people don't work together, when one eats, another has to starve. As long as people don't decide on working together (and I highly doubt manking will ever do that), millenia-old practice of one-eats-another-starves will just continue being the only practice to go forward with (yes West, I am talking to you: your existing high life standards are at the expense of your politico-economical victims across the planet, not because you are exceptionally bright). In that, Singapore definitely has managed to survive.",2021-07-06T00:32:21Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"These laws and norms although harsh require context. In the years when they were drafted it made sense. Although these measures seem extreme and probably are they are what propelled the country to where it is today and kept it there as you have to remember all the external forces that were pressing down on Singapore. As Lee Kuan Yew himself once said ""this nation is like a house of cards that we built, and I am not going to let anyone knock it down"". This quote basically summarises the Singaporean government's approach to democracy. One could also look back to Socrates who once pondered the disadvantages of a democracy since people can vote for anyone they might vote for the wrong person. Also it must be noted that even though the P.A.P. enjoy this much authority and compliance, ministers within the party are still not free to do as they please as remember Singapore has a much lower corruption standard as compared to other developed nations.",2021-07-06T00:23:23Z

Having such influence over politics and matters in the country have lead to most of them simply not taking responsibility when things go wrong and they simply do not care as they know nothing can ever happen to them.  The new generation of ministers taking charge of PAP is no longer the forward thinking party that it once was under the leadership of Lee Kuan Yew, but an overpaid party who's action only happens after a problem has occurred. 

Not saying they have done absolutely terrible but things could've been better and I do not think it's a tall order to ask if they are asking to be paid millions for being the ""top quality"" leaders with certificates and degrees (most of which arent even relavent to the area in which they are tasked with)",2021-07-05T16:10:55Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Singapore controls and governs how people protest for 1 good reason, to ensure that the protest are peaceful and does not disrupt our economy. Look at the US, with the absolute freedom to protest, they have shut off roads, disrupted big and small businesses with emphasis on small business because big businesses have the capital to at least handle a set amount of losses and most importantly, literally insurrected (While debatable by US Republicans) .
Singapore is a small nation, while blocking off a small road isn't a big issue, it becomes a issue for serious concern if Singapore's expressways or major roads are blocked off as they are literally the lifeline of the country. For example when the MRTs started having breakdowns, Singapore economy suffered. 
In additional, as the saying goes, the mob is as smart as the dumbest person in the mob, protests, as clearly shown in the US, have the tendency to morph into a riot. And riots tend to damage whatever the dumbest people feel like damaging. An individual is smart, but put him/her in a heated situation, especially when they in mob and are supporting a just cause, they will feel like whatever they do is right and its for the cause in the heat of the moment. Even if they were to regret it later, it doesn't justify their actions. 
Basically, protests=>riots=>damage to properties both government and civilian=>results in damage and loss revenue to country's economy=>who suffers most? The citizens.=>Government seen as failure.=>want to limit damage and not be seen as failing its citizens? Limit protest so that it doesn't turn into riots.
Singaporeans have the absolute right to criticize the government, just do it in the right channels and and with responsibility. After all. who wants to listen to a fool who sprouts misinformation and conspiracies with no reliable support to back them up what so ever.

The concerns opposition raise are not ones planted by them, but rather already held by the population that voted for them. PAP knows its job is to secure economic growth, but there comes a time where that simply isnt enough.

Only a few countries in Eastern Europe, which had a decent industrial base and were far from poor, barely reached the level of entry-level developed countries after the end of the cold war.  In contrast, you can find a few examples of democracies that have fallen from affluence: Argentina, Chile, Brazil.  To make matters worse, the deterioration in these countries' economic conditions has accelerated rather than stopped.  

For the West, it is better to credit the victory of the cold war to the market economy than to democracy.",2021-07-05T10:12:19Z

We have been successful in our blend of politics, and certainly, do not wish to adopt a full democracy like most Western countries. Such is how it has been, improving the lives of almost all citizens, eradicating homelessness rampant in all western free countries. Zeroised drugs abuse, crimes and all social ills with iron fist, allowing everyone to really live freely, without fear to walk in the streets at any time of the day. And no Singaporean has been gunned down in the streets like what happened, you know where. And we love it here.

But I agree in the aspect that Singaporeans have a strange trait. We love to complain about our politicians. But we detest anyone outside commenting on our country, and that leaves no room to even try poke a finger or nose somewhere.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,13:08 is Seoul,2021-07-05T06:14:07Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Really informative and quite fair. A few inaccuracies here though.

1. The PAP no longer gives ""priority"" to those voting for the PAP. Now opposition parties who run their ""areas"" and ""towns"" (i.e. the Worker's Party) are fully responsible for the repairs in their areas (i.e. elevators and state of government apartment blocks), which will be quickly dealt with as long as they pick up on requests and write ins. One such case which proved as such was when a local influencer, unhappy that the part in her area did not take good care of the flats etc etc, took documented pictures of each faulty/damaged item in her neighbourhood and within 24 hours, all were fixed, showing that as long as you managed to get your local members of parliaments to notice, it would be fixed ASAP.

2. Singaporeans dont generally vote for the PAP because we ""like"" or support the party, or believe that the outcome is already guaranteed. Its just that we havent found another party that has been able to make us believe that electing them in would guarantee social and economic prosperity in the future. Every party that challenges PAP tries to ""defeat"" the PAP does so in the most insignificant method - that being attacking the PAP on one singular policy of theirs, not as a whole, to challenge their ability as the ruling party. Its akin to your colleague telling your boss that you pick your nose in an effort to get your removed from the company.

3. Singapore does not manufacture crises. In fact, everytime there is a crisis (AKA Covid-19) its voting numbers drop like a stone (see 2015 70%, 2020 61.24%), and that the fact that we are a new fragile nation is quite true. The PAP has built a community where expats, multinational corporations can come in a build their businesses here. These MNCs provide jobs, partnerships and diversity to our society and you need to understand some of the opposition parties are completely against this, almost similar to ""jobs for singaporeans only"". As a port city, we need to maintain friendly relations with other countries all over the world and we as citizens, tend not to lean to that. If anything, we've recognised that to be truly prosperous, we need the rest of the world around us.

4. Lastly, take a look at the opposition parties. Have they come forward and shown us some form of security? Aside from its leading party members, the rest of the opposition party members who step up, do nothing to give us a peace of mind or some form assurance that they would be as strong as the PAP members. How should we, as voters, find it in ourselves to even allow them to into parliament? And to be honest, most people qualified to run for parliament, either don't want to run for parliament or they already support the PAP.

5. In the end, lets be frank. We don't want riots or people storming the parliament houses like in the US. Nor do we want elections where we are coerced by military or police to vote where the government wants. We've found a balance, to give a tried and tested party which grew our GDP and comforts considerably over the years. Yes, our country works because (fill in the blanks), but that hasnt stopped any expat from wanting to remain here beyond his/her term. Why? Because its safe, its clean, its comfortable. We might be different but we work. And lets be fair, US just had the least accountable president of 4 years, pretty sure it didnt make the US more efficient or enviable.",2021-07-05T06:12:12Z

We have strict rules against guns anyway 😁 even our most recent riot was human flipping cars rather than someone shooting everyone in the school. I am pretty sure every countries have their good and bad. But at least I am happy with my country that I am able to go out in the middle of the night and reach home safely everyday. Probably sometimes afraid of the ghost that is following me rather than some pale looking guy beating me up cause I got tanned skin 🙈,2021-07-05T04:05:02Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Truth Be Told, Democracies come in various shapes and forms; none of it is exactly the same, and all share one common demominator -Quid pro Quo where politicians campaign on promises they may or may not keep in exchange for the people's votes.  

The substance of Singapore's democractic system is based on a premise that the PAP-led government will be governed by a group of well educated individuals who are honest, competent, people-orientated and dedicated to serve the people. The Oppositions campaign on the premises that they will be an effective 'checks and balance' opposition in parliament in order to keep the ruling party honest and on their toes, by asking uncomfortable public interest questions that PAP MPs are too polite to ask. A WIN-WIN  political scenario for Singaporeans.    

For what's its worth, Singpaore's democracy is essentially a balance between the Rule OF law (for the general populace), and Rule BY law to keep Singapore save from unintended consequences beyond the government's control.  

By and large, the well informed Singapore voters will make a concious calculation that will inevitably put the PAP in government while careful enough to select some quality and sensible oppositions into parliament.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"This video is excellent in explaining Singapore politics

12:00 - the idea is that each constituency is run by the elected MPs, through the Town Councils.
majority of Singaporeans live in public housing that is maintained by TCs, paid regularly by residences through S&CC fees. 

If you vote for an opposition, the leadership of TC changes, including how it's handled, contracts, and support from surrounding constituencies. This means that if you're not PAP, then it's almost ground-up with handling the TC. Aljuned is an interesting one, especially how WP got their audits got raided and charged by PAP.

 Potong Pasir, also, is an interesting one, as they were, up till 2015, run by an opposition. You can tell the start differences between PP and a traditional PAP stronghold - the lack of new house blocks, no hawker centers, only 1 bus svc, no shopping centers (recently there was one new one built after PAP came in, though it's only 1 story), no nursing homes, no polyclinics. AMK, for example, has a new Mall, and adj are 3 old ones that still run, with hawker centers at east, central and west AMK. 

TLDR - they dont outright disallow upgradings and conservancy for non-voters, and dont check each voter's ballots to mark them. Because they can just rely on the fact that a constituency with lesser votes aren't getting 1st priority care, and a constituency with opposition will be automatically handicapped. 

and as far as living in singapore goes, everybody is hard at work or school, and with mental-meltdown-bordering stress, lack of sleep, and fast paced life (literally, we have one of the fastest average walking speeds), we want to make sure that this level of work comes with justified compensation. In a way it does tie in with PAP's vision, since it's hard to go against something that's been doing good, for something that might become unstable and unreliable.

right now opposition serves 3 things for Singaporeans -  replacing the useless MPs of neglected places with a new leader (like Ponggol E); to instill voices in the parliament to keep PAP in check; and to provide a metric of the satisfaction of the population.",2021-07-04T16:51:26Z

Secondly, did you just predict the winner of the 2022 Swedish election?",2021-07-04T15:16:41Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"I think it's important to have a clear understanding of why the PAP is still supported by the majority of its people. To downplay almost 6 decades of strategic leadership and policies and reduce its faults to a simplistic reasoning of not implementing fully liberal democratic ideals is the West is churlish, and more so arrogant. It's not difficult to see why there are raised eyebrows or doubts about the efficacy or peacefulness of democracies in the American or Euro-centric sense, particularly in the discord sowed on the streets within its own indigenuous people, and revolving door governments which leads to unfortunate and short-term populist politics as the mainstay of Western governance.

The day that the PAP fails to get good candidates in its team and convince its people of the calibre of their governance, mark my words that they will be thrown out. Singapore unfortunately does not enjoy the same shared cultures and history as most and is an anomaly in its existence and success. The only reason why people know or talk about Singapore is because it is extraordinary. When Singapore becomes economically insignificant and can't execute social policies well for its domestic concerns be it majority or minority, Singapore will cease to be outstanding, and internationally states will think: Why should I even bother with this small state when there are much bigger economies to befriend? The only future downfall of the PAP will be from its incompetence in its national policies or to rally the support from its diverse racial and religious demographic. It will certainly not be from the lack of Western ""superior"" democratic ideals. Don't assume that we as a national people, are dumb, or helplessly unaware or insulated from what is going on around the world to adapt best practices and make choices for our own contexts.",2021-07-04T15:14:52Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"I've always maintained the opinion that Democracy works best when the population is well-informed, educated, and has a solid national identity. Singapore passes all these so it ought to be ripe for a post-industrial, highly developed democratic society. 
However, the masses are comfortable with the very stable status quo which the current rulers have cultivated.

This is neither a good nor a bad thing but it does make me curious whether a change in leadership would lead Singapore to greater heights or to utter failure. 

Although considering the limits of prosperity, I'd say it's easier to crash than to progress from their lofty point. There is only so much an small city-state can do and Singapore has essentially done it all. So really, it doesn't need democracy. It's fine as is.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"I have always explained to my friends from abroad, Singapore is a Dictatorship disguised as a Democracy. The people here actually know this but we favour peace rather than ""fighting for freedom"". The reason why elections are so predictable is because they group opposition supporters with more of their own supporters in the same ""GRCs"". GRCs are simply put ""electoral divisions"". The number of constituencies or electoral divisions is not permanently fixed by law, but is declared by the Prime Minister prior to each general election, so it is easy to see how they will always have the upper hand since they will always change it to suit their desired outcome. For example, if area A has more opposition while area B and C has more PAP, they would split area A into half and place one with B and the other in C as GRCs. My GRC always seems to change annually. We aren't blind to this though. We complain, and then do nothing about it because we are used to tricks like these. And don't get me started with our current President election haha. Long story short, they added new rules to encourage racial diversity by explaining that only one race can run + other rules that more or less only made their candidate the only ""eligible"" one to run. 

The political scene in singapore is really like no other. People working for the opposition and those who voted for them only want representation. It is clear as day that very few of us actually want a change in ruling party. We just feel that the ministers are ""too comfortable"" in their spots and our needs aren't heard anymore. 

tldr: Our citizens are relatively ""bo chap"" (ie chill) as long as you don't ruin our country. We are doing well, we are relatively comfortable and so we close one eye when it comes to shady things the Govt does.

Just follow the rules, and you will succeed, Singapore's success algorithm is one that's built on meritocracy.

There is new opposition coming in, but Singapore is NOT a dictatorship, this is a wrong statement to make.

I shudder to think what would happen if they actually ran the government.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"As a Singaporean who voted for an opposition party, I feel that there are more factors to add in this issue: 

1) Since most of our housing is Government controlled and owners are chosen through balloting, many Singaporeans fear that voting against the PAP will somehow affect their priority in obtaining said housing. (This is totally baseless from what I know and confirmed through confirmation bias by opposition voters). So it's basically a unsubstantiated fear of government ""sanctions"" (for lack of a better word) for individuals vote dare to oppose the incumbent. 

2) Peer pressure: When I told my Grandmother that I voted for the opposition, she reprimanded me and said ""the PAP has given you so much how can you vote against them"" in Chinese. 

3) The GRC system is flawed imo, even though 60+% of us voted against the ruling party, there are only 10 seats out of a possible 93 allocated to opposition parties. In 2 districts, it was so fucking close down to less that a 5% difference such as West Coast GRC: PAP 51.69% vs PSP 48.31% or East Coast GRC: PAP 53.41% vs WP 46.59%. 10/93 seats is roughly 11% of the total seats, by actual logic, shouldn't there be 40% representation if 40% voted against? This on top of the Gerrymandering by the government almost never gives a fair chance to the opposition. My district changed 3 times over the past 3 elections , first it was Hong Kah, Chua Chu Kang GRC, and now West Coast, and you bet you ass they're gonna redraw the borders again since 48% of us voted against them.  

4) Point 4 is a little of 2 and 3, in some districts, some ""new"" parties with relatively new players to the political scene are pit against the ruling party (which contested all districts) and in such cases some people just vote for PAP since they don't even know who these new comers are. And I have friends who were like ""PAP is gonna win anyway, why not just vote for them"". In these districts it's basically a free W for the PAP.

Even with all these said, I don't think the PAP are the devil incarnate, I just want better representation and someone to keep the ruling party in check, because even right now they can do whatever the hell they want.",2021-07-04T12:06:18Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Democracy isn’t perfect so why adhere to all its conventions? Take a look at the inefficiencies of multiparty bickering and impasses. Who is to say protesting is necessarily a good thing? Take a look at the French or Thai protests disrupting lives for weeks on end.

Who is to say gerrymandering is necessarily a bad thing? If the government is proficient and low in corruption, is stability not better? 

Who is to say a shorter public campaigning period is wrong? If one’s proposals and track record is so great, it’s delivery succinct and digestible, should it not be immediately clear to the populace rather than having the need to explain it over and over again for months on end at great cost and a large diversion of time and manpower that could be better allocated? 

Are low taxes bad if they incentivise startups and employment? Just look at the number of foreign and local companies created in the past 50 years and the local unemployment.

Are meritocratic systems bad simply because they allow those with abilities to succeed more in life? Are there perhaps less skilled Singaporeans left homeless and begging on the streets like those in democratic nations? Who is to say which is more ‘fair’ and ‘equal’? 

Is voting for the opposition as a protest somehow good? Was that not how Trump got so many votes from democrat voters the first time around? 

Is full freedom of the press a good idea if they become opinionated, bigoted or disruptive like Fox? 
(The video also fails to mention which articles have been targeted from news agencies to push this odd narrative that if any news articles are targeted, it must be wrong and it’s media suppression. All humans err, nobody is perfect, so what makes reports unbiased or even factual? Most media tend to cite ‘sources’ which are highly dependent on trust between the source, the reporter and the reader. But who is to say reporters will write with integrity and sources will speak full truths? After all, reporters are free to interpret or worse, edit and omit information that may or may not exist. Without oversight, one could write fables with impunity. When the public reads and trust these reports the impact is then further magnified, so why can’t reporters be held to the same standards as public officials and be judged as such?)

The oddest claim here is zero accountability without context. What does that mean? Local ministers and agencies are still subject to investigations. Government procurements and public works are transparently released online and audited. It’s policies are clear and well stated in the public domain. If anyone in the government commits a crime, they are held responsible and subject to punishments. 

And last but not least, Singapore has existential threats, it is not some fear mongering by the PAP. It is not a naturally rich country, it has no resources, no land, no labour and multiple threats to its existence. In the past, there were racial and religious threats, water threats, food supply threats and many more. Today, it’s economy has already slowed and its productivity stagnating. New trade routes are bypassing the Malacca straits while oil is fading as renewables rise. It’s neighbours will also rise in the near term threatening its prosperity while the volatility of the Sino-Indian tensions will have spillover effects to ASEAN trade and politics. Every part of its economy and stability is neither unique nor outstandingly irreplaceable. Without proper and decisive management, it could just as quickly collapse within the next generation as quickly as it was built by its previous generation.",2021-07-04T11:49:59Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Actually, in my opinion, it's not that the opposition parties are heavily disadvantaged (although I won't say there are no disadvantages for them), rather they simply don't have any game plan.

Take the 2020 elections for example. During the allotted time for campaigning, when asked on live TV what they would do if they won, they had no idea. They kept repeating ideas and ideals (what they want, or ideas they would like to incorporate), there was nothing concrete like ""We will construct a new school for advanced learning in IT due to the rising need for IT specialists, and if we win, it can be done by (insert date here)"". That's concrete. None of them had that...and stated as such on live TV.

So on one hand, yeah, PAP has its issues. Anyone here with half a brain can tell you they're not as clean as they appear to be. That said, they're the only one with a game plan.

""But if you don't give the opposition a chance, how will you know they aren't up to the task?""
Well...because they don't have a plan. When they did get a foot in the door, they dropped the ball (but that's another hotly debated topic). And most importantly, we are not willing to sacrifice a couple of years to watch a group struggle to figure out how to operate a country.

I understand the knee-jerk skepticism of people democratically choosing more government control, but it do be like that sometimes. Other democracies vote for terrorist organizations or theocracies.

So they harbor the idea that in order for the nation to continue to prosper, the PAP should be allowed to stay in power to continue this trend. The younger generation born after the hard times have no way to contrast what hardships the country had to overcome to get to where it is today and are more prone to challenge the status quo due to better education exposure. These are know locally as the ""Strawberry"" generation, a derogatory term used to indicate the inability to undertake hardships.

Singapore's model clearly works. Is it the world's ""only successful dictatorship""? Far from it!

Maybe it is time for the arrogant West that the vast majority of the world don't live in the West and have their own value systems and priorities. Every civilisation has an inherent right to find its own path to prosperity and modernity. In PAP, Singapore has found its recipe, just as China and Vietnam have found the same in the CCP and CPV.

Why is the standard of living of the bottom 20% of Americans or British worse than those in Singapore? You can see the results of the failing of democracy in America in the rising inequality, poverty, drug abuse, suicide and racism. Maybe Polymatter wants to do a comparison of the outcome of education and healthcare investments in Singapore versus the US or UK?
What Polymatter is prescribing is procedural democracy i.e. if a country adopts the Western ideals of democracy and check all the boxes like unfettered free speech, unfettered media freedom, long election period – it is considered good political system despite the fact that incompetent &/or corrupt people are elected to run the govts like what we see in many democracies and as a result the country never progresses. You can see this manifestation in the crumbling infrastructure, insisting the individual right to carry a gun is more important than the safety of the society and more recently in the refusal of people to wear face masks during a pandemic.
What you have in Singapore is outcome-based democracy i.e. the system delivers high standard of living – you can see it in the public housing, healthcare, education and optimism of the people and people are generally happy with their life. Life is not perfect but it could be worse – like what we see in the US, UK, Syria or Afghanistan.",2021-07-04T04:09:08Z

A limiting of freedom, though, not the abolition of it can actually solve a lot of problems, for instanse you want to prevent littering and have literally one of the cleanest cities on earth, well what you do is beat the shit out of people who litter; problem solved.

You have people who want to riot and burn shit to spread political instability and kill people, oh well you fucking shoot those people and the ones you dodged the bullets send them to prison and make them do hard labor for all the shit they burned and have them rebuild it.  Unlike the West that just releases these dirt bags after very little time served.  

You want to solve racism, sure, just integrate racial communities and have really high quality education for people of all races thus giving everyone opportunity.  Also have mandatory contributions to investing so that people aren't poor and that way you don't have blaming of other races for their poverty.

  Oh yeah you want to know the only way to defeat communism?  You ban it, you ban talking about it, ban protests, and ban communist organizations and gatherings.  Oh but we need to have free speach to debate the ideas of communism, NO WE DON'T!  We know it's a bad idea and it killed millions and millions and millions and millions of people; fucking ban that shit.

Singapore has the best education, the freest economy, and the best healthcare on the planet period, and on top of that literally bans racism and bans communism, and if that means giving up some freedom why not.  Most people hate freedom anyways and they implement welfare states that rob the upper and middle class and make everyone poor, push jobs overseas, and increase government overreach.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Why would anyone put off the most important decision they

could ever make in their lives concerning eternal life? If you die today are

you going to heaven? In 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 The apostle Paul tells us what the

gospel is: ""Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I

preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also

you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you

believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also

received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that

He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the

Scriptures. Gospel means ""good news."" Your debt has been paid, the

death penalty has been paid, you are free. Matthew 18:3 - Jesus said:

""Unless you become like this little child you will not enter the kingdom

of heaven."" This is how to be saved, it is simply child like, as simple as

ABC: A - Admit that you are a sinner. This is where that godly sorrow leads to

genuine repentance for sinning against a righteous God and there is a change of

heart, we change our mind and God changes our hearts and regenerates us from

the inside out. Romans 3:10 As it is written: ""There is none righteous,

no, not one."" Romans 3:23 For all have sinned and fall short of the glory

of God. (We are all born sinners which is why we must be born spiritually in

order to enter the Kingdom of Heaven). Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is

death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. The wages

of sin is death, in other words our sin means that we have been given a death

sentence, we have the death penalty hanging over our heads, that's the bad

news. But here's the good news: the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus

our Lord. Ephesians 2:8-9 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith

& this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God, not by works, so that

no one can boast. B - Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ shed his blood and died on the cross for your

sins, was buried, and that God raised Jesus from the dead. This is trusting

with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was. Romans 10:9-10 That

if you confess with your mouth, ""Jesus is Lord,"" and believe in your

heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your

heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you

confess and are saved. C - Call upon the name of the Lord. Every single person

who ever lived since Adam will bend their knee and confess with their mouth

that Jesus Christ is Lord, the Lord of lords and the King of kings. Romans

@ For it is written: ""As I live, says the Lord, Every knee shall bow

to Me, And every tongue shall confess to God."" Don't wait until later, do

this now. Romans 10:13 For ""whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be

saved."" ""O God, I am a sinner. I'm sorry for my sin. I want to turn

from my sin. I believe Jesus Christ is Your Son; I believe that He died on the

cross for my sin and that He was buried and You raised Him to life. I have

decided to place my faith in Jesus Christ as my Savior, trusting only in His

shed blood as sufficient to save my soul and to take me to heaven. Thank You,

Lord Jesus, for saving me. Amen.""",2021-07-03T23:07:00Z

3) And here's the one thing where Singapore is different and is lacking, compared to other similarly developed countries: Have you ever heard about Singaporean Cinema? Or Singaporean music scene? I mean, of course they exist, but... in terms of impact and influence, compare it to Hong Kong Cinema, or to K-Pop, or Chinese Literature not in exile, or Japan's everything. All countries with at least one comparable scale of things like income, social cohesion, freedom, history or even population size. But there's further advantage for Singapore: Almost the entire population is fluent in English and at least one Asian language. You could not have a better cultural platform for a country to have a thriving cultural scene, whether mass media or scholarly arts, and yet, the output it's not there, unless you search for it. And that has nothing to do with their social policies (if everything, those should help, look at the Nordics) or how ""new"" the country is (look at Israel, for better or worse), it's because the country operates as an authoritarian corporation I think.",2021-07-03T22:47:53Z

Main issue being, it's slow, by the time you manage to find a decent comprimise to appease the parties involved, there's already been several other huge matters that they then must start the same process on. 

Democracy is overrated. If a government is oppresive, uncaring, unsafe, fanatic, its not because they're undemocratic. It can spring from that, but thats not the reason. The government is opprseive if its oppresive, fanatic if its fanatic. The people lead the way sounds all well and good, but people are ignorant, irrational and arrogant.

The US is somewhat you considered a democracy, then does US achieve better than Singapore? Apparently not, Singapore people are free from many awful things in the States like guns, racisms etc. I think accountability is not a problem to Singapore but a problem for democracy countries. The policy is revoked by a new regime, and no one is truly accoutable, because they are not in the office, and you cannot send them to jail and punish them if the policy did a damage. But for PAP, they have to consistently fix the problem , because they cannot go away.
I reckon for PAP they definitely need to do a lot of things to get things better and make people happier. There is always room to improve. But no, democracy instalation does not necessirily could make Singapore better in a snap.
My personal View: you do not overturn a successful and stable regime for its minor problem, you do it when the country is dysfunctional and facing severe problem. I do not believe someone will say overturning US for its gun violence, crime rate, decreasing expected life span or racism.

As long as there are free and ""fair"" (uncorrupted) elections, Singaporeans would consider Singapore a democracy.

The unfair advantages that the incumbent party (PAP) has, has helped prevent ""revolving door politics"", the possibility of switching between two parties every election just because of a few policies or policy decisions that didn't quite pan out and/or issues that were mishandled between elections. 

""Revolving door politics"" is very detrimental towards continuity and consistent governance. Case in point the United States, which elects between Democrats and Republicans presidents into the White House every 4-8 years and each parties playing partisan politics e.g. voting against good legislature simply because of party affliation and/or idealogy.

Given the unfair advantages the incumbent has over the opposition parties, if they still fail to garner more than 50% of the seats in parliament, it simply means they have failed Singaporeans (and Singapore) in how citizens feel/think Singapore should be governed. In other words, oppositions in Singapore may never ""actually"" win elections, if they do win, it is because PAP has failed and lost.",2021-07-03T20:13:15Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"As a Singaporean, I would say that not all the arguments put forth are not entirely true but they are not falsehoods either. 

As a small nation that is heavily dependent on its connection with the world, many understand that a change in leadership would definitely upset status quo and therefore create uncertainty and weigh in on economic stability as well. Most citizens thus would most likely vote in favour of the PAP and ensure the longevity of key economic/political/health/financial policies. However, it is important to understand that most Singaporeans do understand our votes and we do see all (or at least, most) of our leaders do try their best to serve the Singapore population and this creates confidence in our political system.  

In the arguments about the disadvantages stated in the video, I would partially disagree with the statements. Many political figures originate from the grass root communities and despite the disadvantages listed, they are not at all disadvantaged from contributing to society and enacting change at a grass root level. Furthermore, the opposition parties are not always represented by ideal leaders and resonate with selected communities in the society. With alternatives not always being the ideal, voting inclinations often shift towards the PAP. 

This does not mean that the opposition creates incompetent leaders nor are they lacking in any way. In our prior election (which I voted for WP, an opposition party), they put up strong cases and pointed out many points of concern in the country. This definitely helped shift some districts in the oppositions' favour but I would definitely hope for the PAP to remain in power, at least till the next election baring in mind that a political change in a country is definitely divisive in nature (see Brexit/American political system). Beyond the stability present in the political status quo, one key subject that is overlooked in this video is that our politicians are actually very accountable and public image is very crucial in the country. 

The political system while rather conservative, has been slowly aligning with social mores and the government do address social concerns when these issues surface. While maintaining this image, this means that the government does its best to please the country by improving standards of living while avoiding topics that could potentially affect its image until it is deemed necessary to address it. This has definitely helped the PAP maintain power but also leaves many gaps in the social fabric of society. 

This creates the presence of taboo topics that the parliament often avoids or addresses in an indirect manner. These topics are that I have mentioned prior. One such topic is race. As a multiracial society, racism is bound to happen and the government strictly cracking down on such topics is only a bandaid solution and does not addresses the underlying issues. This is after the fact that the government has tried many policies to bring people closer together, yet, we still see occasional headlines of racism and ostracization. This is due to a more passive approach to these issues stemming from a more conservative governing body that we have yet to openly talk about these matters in a mature manner. However, I personally think that albeit this is not ideal, it is acceptable, as the government would address these issues when the societal opinions clearly indicate a need for change and being proactive in these matters while ideal, cannot address these issues accurately. It is like pushing for the acceptance of LGBT communities in the 70s/80s - even if the government does go ahead with it, the society might not approve of it and might create friction in the society. Regardless of which way you think is better (social mores influencing politics or politics influencing social mores), Singapore does a pretty good job at pacing the 2 scenarios and most citizens while sometimes unhappy, will accept the outcomes of these discussions.

All in all, the PAP has done a decent job thus far and I do not consider ourselves a strict democracy. However, most countries are also on a spectrum of democracy and we are comfortable with ours (thus the 82%). I cannot speak for the 18% as I am definitely part of the 61-82% that accept our democratic system but vote against the existing governing party. I would definitely say that our governing party is accountable (to a certain extent) to the public and we will definitely not see a potential authoritarian rule of police/militant abuse (since most of the citizens who go through national service ended up in the military or police department of the duration of our national service). Abiding by the legal rule is our way of keeping things civil and rational. I will not comment on the potential legal loopholes but as a whole, Singapore is definitely a capitalist state as our survival depends on it.",2021-07-03T19:08:45Z

Also, why are you using the American colloquial term “Gerrrymandering”, no one uses that term outside the US political discussions, I never heard that colloquialism for underhanded redrawing of voting districts by the incumbent party until I came to the US.",2021-07-03T18:47:11Z

The intersection of all these shipping lanes is the straight of Malacca, or in other words, Singapore.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Regarding the debate between autocracies and democracies, I recommend Gordon Tullock's Autocracy.

Essentially, the major problems of an autocracy are: you get a bad person in charge, and the decision maker is only one person who simply might not know the best course of action (or he selects advisers, but those advisers might not be the best quality, for the same reason, and the advisers don't have an incentive to provide the autocrat with bad news). Essentially, there's the incentive problem and the knowledge problem. In a democratic society there's a feedback mechanism that punishes politicians for failing these problems, but less so in an autocracy (revolution and coups are feedback
mechanisms, but they're hardly optimal).

However, because it's such a crapshoot of the quality of the leader, there's the potential that someone gets in power who is of high quality and outperforms a democracy in a similar situation. Tullock argues that the hereditary monarchy mitigates the worst problems of autocracy (i.e., the worst getting on top) by making sure the person who has power gets it if they want it or not. If there is no choice in who gets power, there's also no incentive to invest in the pursuit of power, which frees up resources for other means. There's also fewer resources spent in debate - what the autocrat says, goes. The benefit of democracy is that it encourages debate, so there are fewer egregious errors.

So I would say, ultimately, that autocrats have a small probability of outperforming a similar democracy (or constitutional republic, etc), but a much larger probability of succumbing to either incentive or knowledge problems. If you're a risk-seeking gambler, you might bet on an autocracy, but the average performance for a democracy will (probably) be better and the potential downside much lower.",2021-07-03T18:25:25Z

Most of us Singaporeans just want to live well in a peaceful place, and in this respect the PAP has done extremely well.

 It's a shame war decides how we live as I think we should have the choice and vote with our feet instead of only being able to support one of the political parties on offer at the polling stations.

Instead of fighting and loosing elections we should just be able to move, physically east or west to find the point at which we feel comfortable with the tax rate and quality of public services, freedom and security.

We could do away with prisons and instead just restrict the movement of the criminal to a province where the crime they committed is legal for a set period of time.

The levels could be; 

1. no tax, no law, eat what you grow, own what you make. (For violent and organised crimes. Example, multiple cold blooded murders is a restriction for life to remove the murderer from society whilst killing in self defence could just be a 6 month deterrent.)

2. Very low tax for police. Laws stop danger to life. (For Property and public order crime such as theft and substance abuse.)

3. Low tax for transport infrastructure. Laws maintain order and economy. (For white collar crimes.)

4. Medium tax for free education and health care. Laws provide workers rights. (For breaking 'high tax place' laws.)

5. High tax for the right to housing, energy, water, sewage, food and internet. Laws provent activities that are bad for climate change such as eating meat, flying and driving non-electric cars.

Now that he passed away, some MPs are even asking if Singapore currencies can bear the face of Lee Kuan Yew.

PM Lee Hsien Loong replied that ""It was not monuments but ideals that were his chief concern, the ideals upon which he built Singapore: multi-racialism, equality, meritocracy, integrity and the rule of law. He hoped these ideals would endure beyond him. We can pay no greater tribute to Mr. Lee than to uphold the principles upon which he built this country.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Before some of you claimed it's also because the opposition are weak and lousy at the same time. Remember that the election has already put Opposition in a disadvantage way before the election/voting period has started like the video stated.
Yes, some of the policies that smaller opposition parties have created are crap but the disadvantages mentioned in video don't make it any different for more credible opposition party like Workers Party (WP).
I just gonna copy and paste a comment that I come across below because I want to get my point across, and this explained it well.

""The ruling party has virtually unlimited resources and manpower, while each of the opposition parties are relatively small. And if any of them win a district in the elections, that district will be cut off from any and all government resources. Just look at Hougang, for a good example. All the government-funded upgrading works and development projects in progress just got abruptly cut and abandoned midway after the PAP lost the local elections. 
It makes the WP look incompetent because everything is suddenly not working anymore the moment they stepped in. In reality the PAP is actively denying the district access to government services. After all, you didn't vote for the PAP, so why should they give you access to their stuff? It also just so happens that the HDB, the utility companies, and government services all belong to them so... zoop!

But I do think that the majority of Singaporeans vote for the PAP because they are for the most part, rather competent. Also on that note, I don't see how dominant party democracies are less desirable or legitimate (take the LDP in Japan for example). If a party is doing well, like the PAP, it is entirely rational for voters to want to keep them in power. As Lee Kuan Yew wryly noted, the firsts from Oxbridge can be found in Singapore's government, the 2:1s and 2:2s in the House of Commons.

In any case, I don't think Singapore would ever fall into authoritarianism (no, it's not authoritarian now, more like illberal or paternalistic). What keeps a democracy from becoming authoritarian are its institutions in my opinion. That's the reason why the democratic experiments in Iraq and Libya have failed, and why Afghanistan is the next in line. On the other hand, the institutions in Singapore are sufficiently mature, and in general the country and the PAP are slowly but surely liberalising the system.",2021-07-03T16:00:15Z

Districts where the opposition party won the election, get significantly less funding from the governtment so all the residents in those districts ""suffer"", even those that voted for PAP within the district.  ITS STILL JUST AS BAD AS INDIVIDUAL VOTERS GETTING PREFRENTIAL TREATMENT  BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE SO ITS ALMOST KINDA MISLEADING I GUESS.

Gerrymandering forces some areas to be under the name of a different GRC, even if the namesake of the GRC is far away from the supposed area. This is why the election map can change drastically every year, and causes most to be confused.",2021-07-03T15:42:50Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"The video presents the facts reasonably objectively. But the major failing is that Polymatter did not fully explore the alternatives. By framing the subject as ""more democracy"" vs ""less democracy"" it disregards the situation and context of Singapore as a nation. The country did not choose the tyranny of meritocracy and autocracy as simply an efficient means of developing the country.

Singapore is surrounded by Muslim nations. It had to choose and stand by core principles of secularism. The alternative would be ethno-politics (see Malaysia, Indonesia etc) and it could not afford this. Looking at the situation simply by describing the situation today misses the point that the country had (and continues) to navigate a very delicate path.

The people opposed to the fledgling country 55 years ago were not progressive democracy seeking. I am not singing praises to the PAP but any in depth analysis of Singapore must bring into context the countries surrounding it. The racial riots of the 60's and all the way to the late 90's in Indonesia are, unfortunately, the more realistic alternatives to the authoritarian regime in Singapore rather than the rose tinted descriptions of a ""more fair"" democracy.",2021-07-03T15:41:47Z
Hkxf4SC_SBk,"As a Singaporean, I appreciate the depth that you've spent into looking at how our 'democracy' (or lack of it) works, especially with how votes are treated more like an opinion poll, rather than a actual choice. Great video!

I think it bears pointing out also that the majority of Singaporeans are fully literate in English, as well as our respective second languages (Mandarin, Malay, Tamil), and well educated (generally). Unlike other major undemocratic countries such as China or Russia, the government by and large also does not block overseas content (except for major porn sites :/). So most Singaporeans do often consume content from western media perspectives (regardless of their political alignment). And just as you have mentioned in your other videos, we are a hub of foreign investment, so we do see a lot of foreigners come and go, along with their world views.

So Singaporeans (in general, especially the younger generation) are well aware of the freedoms we lack compared to western countries, yet we are also aware of the flaws of those systems. Contrary to the opinions that we are brainwashed or too used to authoritarianism and thus resistant to change, most voters place their votes with PAP and the opposition parties with this holistic awareness (at least I hope). 

As you have shared in both this video and previous ones, we are a tiny country with no natural resources whatsoever. While larger countries can afford testing their political systems with minor consequences (relatively), Singapore cannot afford a 'wrong move', we would simply collapse and vanish as a nation. Which is why we are more accepting of the status quo with the PAP compared to rapid democratisation.",2021-07-03T15:40:44Z

In the west the social contract is that democracy decided the legitimacy of the government, but this doesn't work in the east. In eastern societies, the social contract is about the government being able to provide the necessities for its people, with stability and prosperity. The state is meant to be relied on, to be trusted, not seen as something to be removed from ones life unlike that in the west.

A mistake many people in Western countries make when discussing east Asian countries is viewing them through the lens and value system of Western countries. This will only leave them puzzled as to why, for example, the CCP enjoys so much support in China. The social contract is different, and to many Chinese people, the CCP has fulfilled their view of what a government should be, and therefore enjoy widespread support in China. I'd wager that if China turns democratic(firstly, it won't happen), the CCP will win the election",2021-07-03T15:14:46Z

One, the alternative views are generally not being propagated. More of such views are available because of social media combined with a more educated population that knows where to draw the line (before it becomes defamation). 

Two, most of us are more concerned about economic growth over true democracy. PAP's policies are favourable to the middle class (which most of us are) and it improves our standard of living. We don't want policies to change every election because of power changing hands. 

Three, the opposition do not have enough candidates of good calibre. It is something that has improved in the most recent election but in the past most of them are a big joke.

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"singaporean here and i find this video really accurate and impressive (except for the way you said PAP which many have pointed out :<)

to add on to the video, i think the most impressive thing that the ruling party has done has really been just taking politics out of the equation in our lives. you might hear people occasionally discussing current affairs and what the government has done, people might complain about it, but no one would actually wonder about the policy objectives or why its the case. these discussions are kept hush, within closed doors but there is almost an unspoken agreement not to bring it into public spheres. also, the public never thinks of opposing the government, ""the government said so"" is always enough of a justification to do something or not do something. 

the ruling party has understood the very nature of singaporeans. we are an immigrant-based society, and almost everyone that immigrated here was destitute and poor in their hometowns coming here to seek a better life. economic conditions precede every other thing in life, and this attitude has been passed down generations. the ruling party has played into this, giving us what many want- public housing, jobs, safety. and it has also played a large role in further shaping attitudes to their advantage, such as implementing the ideology of pragmatic realism and teaching of the great things that our ""founding fathers"" have done - giving us stability and good economic conditions. thus, PAP has become synonymous with peace and prosperity, which is why their power would likely not wane anytime soon and the people accept the trade-off of lack of political diversity and freedom. whether this trade-off is arbitrarily created by the PAP or reality, until the day the PAP is dethroned and opposition comes into power, we would never know.

for now, i sincerely hope that the PAP can lead us in the right direction. the PAP has planted both trust and doubts about the future of my country, but regardless, who is holding power never matters as much as his heart for the country and what he would do to better our lives. all the best singapore. i love you",2021-07-03T15:04:46Z

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"Singaporean here. 
I think what you mentioned about the gerrymandering and legal campaign period are spot on. My home is categorised under a GRC that is literally kilometres away from me. The 'getting charged for ridiculous reasons' thing is also quite real, earlier this year there were people arrested for protesting against LGBT discrimination by the education ministry. One thing that smells a bit fishy to me, however, is the 'vote for PAP to receive special benefits' thing you talked about at 12:35. I have never heard of such a thing before, and our votes are supposed to be anonymous. I'd love to see your source on that.

EDIT: I stand corrected. Apparently that was the case in the past. Not sure if it's still the case but it used to be.

I think most of us, especially the older generation, aren't extremely bothered by the lack of opposition in politics because life in Singapore isn't THAT bad, it's actually pretty comfortable. I think most people are just alright with the status quo and fear that change may disrupt it. Personally, I'm not very bothered about politics as long as the government in power gets the job done, which they have been for quite a few decades now.
However, nowadays I think more people are better educated on our political scene and are more cognisant of the issues that have arisen as a result of the essentially one-party rule. That's probably why the PAP is starting to lose some of its voters.

Nevertheless, if it really comes to it, I think Singaporeans would gladly vote for the oppositions if it meant that we'd have a better standard of living. I don't know if I can speak for everyone but to me, as long as Singapore continues to progress, I don't care which party is in power. We still have a long way to go, but either way I'm proud to be Singaporean.

One thing I've always found funny when foreigners discuss Singapore online is that we are commonly downplayed and called names like 'Disneyland with a death penalty' or 'fine city'. I've even seen people on Reddit talk about us Singaporeans like we're some deeply oppressed slaves living in an Orwellian society. Maybe it's just me and my outlook on life but I don't think it's anywhere near as bad as that. Sure, we may have some serious issues regarding mental health and our happiness, or lack thereof it, but in general I think most of our issues stem from the cost of living and the constant rat race here. I really admire you for the amount of research you put into this video though, it's pretty solid. Good job man

Hkxf4SC_SBk,"""All information from the country is mouth piece to the party"" ""The information of Singapore says is people like the state party"" I wonder why there is difference between the vote and approval rating. After all they are all such reliable source of information. 

Further democratization would rip there source of power and there disregard for opposition means they would not take this well. The Singapore system has avoided going full authoritarian state but  it is doomed to become one. Is matter of time. Such is the nature of ""benevolent dictator"". They only benevolent until they can't remember why it need to be benevolent when it has all the power. 

Also the idea the only stopping from doing X is just politics. Is incredible childish and dismisive. We are talking about policy that implimented in other country would showcase serious violation of rights at mass scale in most countries. And so much more that just call it political opinion is childish dismisal.

  Because is the same as saying the only way to solving the world problem are stopping the people being people. Congrats on that bit of wisdom!  

This is why further democratization will never be the answer. All it take is serious prolong world crisis that undermine the party ability to maintain is economy and you will see how quickly Singapore goes full authoritarian. Is that it feel no real threat that allow to maintain this facade. The second it feel threathen it will be as democratic as Qatar. Why gerrymender when you can just uncitizen the opposition.

To say that many governments impose limits on the freedom of their people for some sort of benefit is fair, but to ignore Singapore's distinguished position amongst developing countries as *very* willing to control even the finer details of the lives of ordinary citizens by misleadingly comparing the chewing gum ban to the New York Soda Cap is somewhat disingenuous.",2021-07-03T14:44:22Z

Just wanted to point out that you're absolutely correct when you say most voters who vote for the opposition are merely sending a message - as an opposition supporter myself I do still see the merits of the PAP and do not wish for a hasty transition of power when the country is not ready for it. Furthermore, this may just be due to the unfair election process as you mentioned, but the general consensus among the public is that the PAP candidates do tend to be more capable/competent (this is a personal opinion/observation, up for debate)

It's rare for opposition parties to field teams of talented, capable candidates who are capable of beating the PAP in an unfair election, but it has been happening in the past couple of elections, and I'm hoping for more competent candidates to step up for opposition parties, in the hopes of eventually (hopefully) obtaining a 80-20 ratio in parliamentary seats.

Singapore is indeed a great place to live especially if you wish to remain ignorant of the lack of political freedom, but I do believe having a slightly stronger opposition voice would keep the PAP in check and do great things for the country in the long run.",2021-07-03T14:26:59Z

As a Singaporean, I am very grateful for your unbiased and fair coverage of Singaporean matters and the Singaporean situation. From my experience, many younger people (and future voters) are aware of some of these tactics employed to skew our elections. Hopefully one day these practices will change. Also, not sure if the ""blank cheque"" reference was intentional, but if it was, good on you! Thanks for this video, much appreciated :)",2021-07-03T14:23:12Z

0. As a Chinese majority country in the sea of Malay, most of the populace have the determination to protect and improve themselves. 
1. They maintain their relationship well with their neighbors who protect them in exchange of economic boost (Indonesia and Malaysia)
2. One of the most powerful trade node
3. Multicultural Etnostate (While Hokkien Chinese has the majority (over 70% of the nation) they do not have time for social discrimination. Most of their government, military, and powerful positions are reserved for Hokkien Chinese (read it online) because of their long time rivalry with Malays.
4. A powerful stable government that allow corruption if its for the greater means. They also copied British bureaucracy for their government.
5. They do not have the same religious values as the neighboring countries allowing them to flexibly maintain relation with Israel and USA.",2021-07-03T14:22:32Z

Singapore's living condition is really really good compared to the US, Malaysia and Indonesia..etc etc for someone of my income level (lower class to middle class. Currently take home $3.8K before CPF. much better than most ppl i know in the States). yea I am happy with the ruling party. Tbh, the opposition party in Singapore isn't impressive at all.

I want a government that makes Singapore economically powerful, her citizens healthy, wealthy and well educated. 💃 And PAP did it.


Edit: yes we can criticise the government. Nobody has arrested me yet. To prove it to u, well..
FUCK THE PAP
FUCK THE CIRCUIT BREAKER.
FUCK THE BTO SYSTEM.

WHY INCREASE ELECTRICITY TARIFFS.

3) maintains armed forces that don't project its presence against their neighbors;
4) doesn't tolerate even rumors of corruption by officials at any level; and
5) allows open challenges to the ruling party, even in the face of declining popularity
